"Yes, I agree, Ditum’s article is really strange as an attack. It can be also interesting from another point of view, but the low blows against Assange and supporters are always the same and they’re put in even when they have nothing to do with the article itself. Also, I think Hyde’s “joke” is very telling: it isn’t a proper criticism so MediaLens can’t answer back, but still it pushes a dangerous (and too much rooted) smear. When they don’t know how to attack they use the “conspiracy/paranoia” card.",2015-08-25 07:40:37,voidiss

They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now… now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group’s human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is ‘conquering the term’; I mean, real feminism isn’t that “trigger warning”/”rape culture” crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course — as every other conservative/reactionary ideology — has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women’s rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don’t do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you’re indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don’t want to be left out.",2015-10-14 09:34:12,voidiss

"I’m doing a thing I’d like to share with you all… This year my school offered the partecipation in a project called NHSMUN (National High School Model United Nation), that is a big project initially created by IMUNA and organized by different associated orgs in each country (like Italian Diplomatic Academy in Italy). And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‘simulation’ of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‘resolution’. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don’t want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‘how things work’ in UN etc. A bit like ‘know the enemy’, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway… today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I’ll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‘delegate’ are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan. So, that is, I just wanted to let you all know about this thing because I think it’s going to be interesting. I will share more about it! 🙂",2015-12-17 12:05:29,voidiss

"That sculpture at logancij – other than a neat piece of art itself – is also a small model for a future real-size sculpture. In Berlin (I don’t remember where) there’s already a hourglass sculpture and an artist is in the process of asking to the officials in charge of that the permission to paint it with WL logo colours, so there will be a WL ‘monument’ in Berlin centre!",2016-03-13 07:30:02,voidiss
"This kind of slow, silent expansionism that we see in the Aegan makes me think that ‘neutral zones’ have no chance of survival in this world, because the most powerful country in question would surely find a way to slowly overcome the ‘neutral’ barrier. When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into ‘international zone’, therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that – even if the situation are different – this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a ‘frontier zone’ between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there’s an established sovereignty, it’s easy to create ‘grey zones’, make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world’s attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it’s clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too. Plus, if we consider that the external superpowers will help the powerful country in question (as NATO with Turkey, more or less), neutral zones can be nothing but facades.",2016-03-13 11:07:01,voidiss

"IMHO, maybe in this case it’s better to avoid RT/Sputnik’s articles on WL comments about attacks on Putin etc. They tend to twist the meaning, as if WL said the whole Panama Papers were set up to ruin Russia and all those things, while actually they only pointed out to the US funds and some outlets’s focus on Putin.
