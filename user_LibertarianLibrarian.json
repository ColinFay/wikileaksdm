The issue is that even the best ‘analytic’ research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered.

As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid.

No one has a clue what’s going to happen re Obamacare. And generally we all knew we were spied on anyway and no one ever liked the CIA, so I suspect the average person’s response is ‘so what’s new?’ Sad, but I had kinds thought the same thing.","date":"2017-03-11 10:14:05","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"I don’t watch network news or read NYT, rarely WaPo, because they’re hired shills for whoever is paying them the most.

They provide bibliographic databases and citation management software. They are one of the big vendors in the library world. Not quite as horrible as the giant publishers like Elsevier but still big and costly. Nice giveaways at conferences, though.

Just dumped over 5000 articles on medication adherence in organ transplant patients into EndNote, speaking of the 👹.","date":"2017-03-16 15:16:34","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"Yeah. My cousin briefly worked in the mail room of the White House under Clinton so he thinks the Clintons walk on water. He is functioning enough to do basic jobs and take public transport, but impressionable and developmentally delayed.

Apparently his people are discussing trying to force people on Medicaid to work… but the primary reason for getting Medicaid is because you can NOT work – it goes to the handicapped and children. The only plus is that this is showing DC for the utter farce it is. But seriously???","date":"2017-03-16 15:32:02","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"That’s insane! I’m a strong anti-govt-involvement advocate but there are reasons why we have to have the necessary evil, and taking care of children and the disabled is on that list. It’s sick how much power the military and its parasitic industries have. We could solve so many problems if we just cut our military spending by even a fifth.

As terrible as it was, The 5th Estate made me investigate the truth about JA & WL and listening to the real JA made a huge change in how I think and see the world me.","date":"2017-05-01 17:10:30","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"‘Around me’","date":"2017-05-01 17:11:00","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"Oh good grief. All that time & work and she doesn’t have enough pride in it or responsibility for it, to present it honesty? Maybe it’s because I provide medical information to doctors and patient families that can affect a child’s health and life, but it just blows my mind when people misrepresent reality so casually. It’s not even a pure fact versus dramatic presentation difference, much in pediatrics is based on limited evidence and clinician judgement, but just just an ethos of personal responsibility and trust when what you do and say impacts people’s lives. Never understood deliberate lying or falsifying or shading truth just out of greed or ambition.","date":"2017-05-02 11:20:28","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"I know it’s a staple of politics and etc. But… I’m just disgusted.","date":"2017-05-02 11:22:06","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"text":"It’s going to be very interesting to see the final version (would love to see earlier ones as well).
