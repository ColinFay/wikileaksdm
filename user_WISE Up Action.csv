The piece is kind of ‘languid’, flits about. Probably because he is unfamiliar with/uninterested in the real issues (as in geopolitics/justice/truth etc!). But he doesn’t go on about the Swedish case at all; there’s much more about the US case, which he seems to take at face-value (despite that quote fr Appleyard). So it’s good in that it doesn’t belittle the threat to Assange even saying “he may be right about that” w ref to JA’s conviction that Ny’s delaying tactics are to serve the US timescale, enable them to build their case. The worst thing is, that, apart from a ref to the “horrifying footage” of Collateral Murder, he has no regard for/understanding of the ground-breaking work of WikiLeaks, or JA’s role (so, what’s new?). It ends with the terrible “he’s a hero to many in the land of protest for protest’s sake” after citing who he’s a villain to and why.

"Ok, just putting this out there: I am a new postgrad student at UCL and am still finding my feet there. I live outside London and study PT so I feel a bit out of the loop in many ways. Last week I had my undergrad graduation ceremony at Birkbeck during which the president, Joan Bakewell, lambasted Cardiff’s attempts to stop Germaine Greer speaking – JBs view was that freedom of speech and the ability to debate should always prevail at an educational establishment – a view most would share? At the same time UCLU have got into a mess re Macer Gifford. It’s delicate because Gifford’s supporters are insinuating at some sort of ‘Islamist’ bias against them in the union and mentioning orgs like Cage negatively and Cage’s is a counter narrative that I have supported. The Cambridge thing is a total joke! But one thing I have noticed re UCL and which may apply elsewhere is simply that some of these individuals in the union have disproportionate influence and yet are quite naive / inexperienced / uninformed to say the least.

I have cc’d this to Emmy, who will be co-ordinating the vigil, and will be there on the day. Meanwhile, this is the submission the UN will be responding to: https://justice4assange.com/IMG/pdf/assange-wgad.pdfhttps://justice4assange.com/UN-Working-Group-on-Arbitrary.htmlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElKL6T74BvQ&feature=youtu.be",2016-02-03 12:46:56,WISE Up Action
