(please don’t!) review: “The book itself is split into two parts: “Lies” (including “Children Make You Happy,” “Women Are the Natural Parent,” “Breast is Best,” “Children Need Their Parents,” “‘The Hardest Job in the World’,” and “MOther Knows Best”) and “Truth” (including “Giving Up on Parenthood,” “‘Bad’ Mothers Go to Jail,” “Smart Women Don’t Have Kids,” “Death of the Nuclear Family,” “Women Should Work,” and “Why Have Kids?”). Those titles themselves speak for themselves on how the author seems to view parenting.” http://www.amazon.com/Why-Have-Kids-Parenting-Happiness/product-reviews/0547892616/ref=cm_cr_dp_qt_hist_one/176-9522678-0431658?ie=UTF8&filterBy=addOneStar&showViewpoints=0","date":"2015-08-18 15:59:43","user":"noll"},{"url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2012/08/25/review-why-have-kids-jessica-valenti/2uznLvBG01hxFmsqsWFHBM/story.html","text":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2012/08/25/review-why-have-kids-jessica-valenti/2uznLvBG01hxFmsqsWFHBM/story.html","date":"2015-08-18 16:08:48","user":"noll"},{"url":"http://sofiawilen.com","text":"interestingly, the http://sofiawilen.com","date":"2015-08-18 22:27:54","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://pentagonmoney.com","text":"the site domain no longer re-directs to http://pentagonmoney.com","date":"2015-08-18 22:29:19","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://www.sofiawilen.com","text":"Heh! 😀 I had left my tab open from yesterday’s Domain Tools Search here is the screenshot that shows 18.08.2015 search result for http://www.sofiawilen.com","date":"2015-08-18 22:44:16","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/633877504181293059/633877504210694144/4C_buBhp.png","text":"[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/633877504181293059/633877504210694144/4C_buBhp.png","date":"2015-08-18 22:45:48","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://archive.is/QpAgP","text":"Archived domain search here: https://archive.is/QpAgP","date":"2015-08-18 22:55:32","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://julianpaulassange.com/","text":"Yeh – there’s a fair bit that’s actually dated 2015 – even this month http://julianpaulassange.com/","date":"2015-08-18 22:58:37","user":"WISE Up Action"},{"url":"https://archive.is/zWqKN","text":"Thx, good morning from me, off to the bakery for fresh Galaktobureko yumm! on a lighter note, read comments here: https://archive.is/zWqKN","date":"2015-08-18 23:09:14","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://youtu.be/Z8ip1Up2taQ","text":"A 3 minute video on Christine Ann Sands behaviour outside Hamstead Christchurch that caused her conviction in April 2015 https://youtu.be/Z8ip1Up2taQ","date":"2015-08-19 01:19:43","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://justice4assange.com","text":"I couldn’t get the http://justice4assange.com","date":"2015-08-19 05:59:39","user":"LibertarianLibrarian"},{"url":"https everywhere didn’t help.","text":"Nope, same on desktop in both browsers.

The new deep state reign retains all its business/legal and other societal channels and adding to that the part of society previously excluded or being kept under check the Islamist hopefuls. The presence of Grey Wolves in Syria’s Turkmen community (publicly giving interviews about the shooting down of the Russian pilot) reveals their role and even gives it a public role. In retrospect the Ankara bombings who targeted Kurdish democratic rallies with their high death toll, fits the profile of a Grey Wolves operation. It is alright for Erdogan to conveniently claim ‘it was ISIS’ and fit with West’s political hypocritical rhetoric about giving a damn for a problem they have created and sustain as a tool of furthering their influence and control in the region. The Ankara Bombing of Kurdish political wing by Turkey’s deep state (via Grey Wolves) is no different to them bombing the Kurds in Nothern Iraq overtly. Let’s not forget Grey Wolves attempted to kill Turgut Ozal Turkish Prime Minister in the 80’s so not only their ambitions, properly sheltered by the deep state, have no end, https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&dat=19880620&id=7TNAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5252,5375442&hl=en","date":"2015-11-27 02:34:30","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Özal","text":"See here what kind of politician Ozal was: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_Özal","date":"2015-11-27 02:35:04","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://www.mfa.gov.tr/and-the-world_s-largest-enclave.en.mfa","text":"sorry I am meandering in other matters but let’s say planned annexation of Turkmen Syrian lands came a bit of a surprise to me, Turkish state has been working on their annexation plans of Greek prefecture of Thraki more overtly, again the same template, “we shall have to intervene to protect HR etc”: see here: “The World’s largest enclave” http://www.mfa.gov.tr/and-the-world_s-largest-enclave.en.mfa","date":"2015-11-27 03:10:24","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/670198164322959363/670198164369088512/LMDJMVvX.png Under the watchful eye of the butcher of Ismir","text":"[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/670198164322959363/670198164369088512/LMDJMVvX.png Under the watchful eye of the butcher of Ismir","date":"2015-11-27 03:11:08","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://www.thelocal.se/20151127/swedish-court-we-cannot-ban-pirate-bay","text":"Swedish court rules ISPs can’t be forced to block Pirate Bay http://www.thelocal.se/20151127/swedish-court-we-cannot-ban-pirate-bay","date":"2015-11-27 09:55:22","user":"M"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/xtophercook/with_replies","text":"Please troll this BBC idiot: https://twitter.com/xtophercook/with_replies","date":"2015-11-27 14:42:52","user":"WikiLeaks"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/Libyan_News/status/670349278464864256 https://twitter.com/Libyan_News/status/670349278464864256http://www.arrakmia.com/231834/%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B3-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D8%AA-50-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%B3/","text":"[Tweet] https://twitter.com/Libyan_News/status/670349278464864256 https://twitter.com/Libyan_News/status/670349278464864256http://www.arrakmia.com/231834/%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B3-%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D8%AA-50-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%B3/","date":"2015-11-27 15:32:28","user":"M"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/WDR2/status/670530939626397696 German mini-podcast marking 5 years since Cablegate.","text":"[Tweet] https://twitter.com/WDR2/status/670530939626397696 German mini-podcast marking 5 years since Cablegate.","date":"2015-11-28 02:10:34","user":"M"},{"url":"https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/670922126623449091/670922126644420608/0NmEw10X.png First","text":"[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/670922126623449091/670922126644420608/0NmEw10X.png First","date":"2015-11-29 03:07:54","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://www.rt.com/news/323861-turkey-greek-airspace-violations/","text":"Then: https://www.rt.com/news/323861-turkey-greek-airspace-violations/","date":"2015-11-29 03:08:19","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/670922499924893699/670922499945820160/DNVaAfN6.png","text":"[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/670922499924893699/670922499945820160/DNVaAfN6.png","date":"2015-11-29 03:09:23","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"https://twitter.com/peterjukes/status/670606979321212928 Our wonderful media again","text":"[Tweet] https://twitter.com/peterjukes/status/670606979321212928 Our wonderful media again","date":"2015-11-29 09:37:13","user":"WISE Up Action"},{"url":"https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/11/26/actualidad/1448548222_604295.html&prev=search","text":"David Leigh writing in the El Pais about Cablegate. https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/11/26/actualidad/1448548222_604295.html&prev=search","date":"2015-11-29 13:43:36","user":"Emmy B"},{"url":"http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/11/27/actualidad/1448644931_870427.html","text":"Javier Moreno wrote this one: http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/11/27/actualidad/1448644931_870427.html","date":"2015-11-29 14:00:09","user":"voidiss"},{"url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjYYw4cnVEQ&feature=youtu.be","text":"@ h Turkmen from China?
