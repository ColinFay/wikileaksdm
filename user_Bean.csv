thanks all for the timeline suggestions… original idea was to show ongoing activity of US investigation vs lack of activity from the swedish prosecution… so will incorporate some more of those US actions… and good point jenny – yes has been a bit tricky to fit it all in legibly as want it to be an image that can be easily shared (something that can fit on a web page/blog/article) – bolder lines will probably help… will have a further look at it all tomorrow… thx,2015-09-02 14:52:00,Bean

sorry to disappoint but MT is certainly not a man of his word – he’s a multimillionaire career politician – just one example: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/no-internet-filter-says-turnbull/4939156,2015-09-14 06:22:41,Bean
he’s smarter than abbott which just makes him more dangerous – and possibly electable,2015-09-14 06:24:06,Bean
would he still do this in power? – i’m sceptical – haven’t time to expand or find decent material on him at the moment (sorry!) – but my impression of him over the years is as a very slippery character – a cunning manipulator,2015-09-14 06:45:13,Bean
so unpopular now he would lose the next election – seen as mismanaging economy (amongst other things) as the australian economy slides due to too many eggs in the chinese resources market basket (try repeating that fast!)…the usual internal factional battles within the liberal party (not that they have ‘official’ factions like labor)…abbott knifed turnbull in the back to get leadership when in opposition (by one vote in 2009) so payback time… turnbull has had his eye on being pm for years and the time was right to roll abbott – now gives them chance to win next election with a new (old) face – turnbull has credibility in eyes of many liberal Liberal voters… that’s my quick and crude analysis!,2015-09-14 08:24:45,Bean
