"Whether it was a horribly mistaken or not, the election clearly showed how angry the average American is with the Washington power structure.

"A good point there! I keep thinking of the gravy train with US/UK arming Saudia Arabia how many orders are in the pipeline‚Ä¶ billions, and how his re-approachment with Russia is undermining decades worth of US/UK policy propping up islamists and others to counteract Russia, The British Empire followed the same policy before the Soviet Era. How on earth Trump is going to be allowed to go forward with a change in foreign policy?A recent Greek PM Karamanlis who tried to re-approach with Russia (without compromising Greece‚Äôs commitment to Nato) and the Pythia op planned his assassination by US interests, he resigned before the end of his term triggering an election. How far would such interests go to protect the existing foreign policy?",2017-01-04 14:13:19,Emmy B
"Good question, Emmy. I think he may make China and the Islamics (whatever they‚Äôre called lately) into the bad guys. I‚Äôm delighted to see Clinton‚Äôs anti-Russia agitating didn‚Äôt get further, but I‚Äôm worried a bit re China. Trump will have to be careful there. But I can see Trump and Putin siding together more in regards to the Middle East. Not sure if that will be a disaster or a success, probably a mix, but I‚Äôm sick of this resurgent McCarthyism recently. Bad, bad, bad idea. Trump‚Äôs a wild card. I think that‚Äôs why I wasn‚Äôt surprised he won and not upset either. He‚Äôs a sexist narcissist but that‚Äôs not new in political leaders.",2017-01-04 14:32:20,LibertarianLibrarian

"It‚Äôs really bizarre how Americans have been led to believe simultaneously that Julian is under Putin‚Äôs thumb and that he‚Äôs gone ‚Äòright wing‚Äô, both of which are clearly absurd and contradictory with each other (as most Americans still associate Russia with communism to some degree). Sarah Palin (this no endorsement of her) was ridiculed for saying the Russians are coming‚Ä¶ Yet now it‚Äôs Clinton saying the same thing and suddenly it‚Äôs not ridiculous?

"Thanks. Just letting off steam. The whole Putin is the bad guy thing is absurd and out of hand. And why can‚Äôt people get the simple concept that WL can only release what it‚Äôs been given, can‚Äôt magically make up stuff on Trump. And source is irrelevant, all the stuff on Clinton and DNC is TRUE however bad Trump may or may not be. Like Duh!!! When otherwise intelligent people repeat this stuff‚Ä¶ *steam comes out of my ears*",2017-01-07 16:18:59,LibertarianLibrarian
"The thing is why didn‚Äôt the pro-Clinton media found good stuff for Clinton in the Podesta e-mails? it was her campaign manager after all, if they found nothing good about her in there well he was at least a lousy campaign manager, I have not heard one bad word written about him, complete denial of any responsibility. Yet they let their country go through this turmoil of ‚ÄòRussia phobia‚Äô as if they are some kind of banana republic. How will the rest of the world see the US intelligence services playing the role that they do and Obama encouraging the ‚ÄòI am shaking in my boots because of little Russia‚Äô the elephant scared of the mouse kind of thing, US has 900 military bases around the world is this the way to behave for internal consumption and to protect the gravy train deals with Saudi and the rest of ME tyrants? Is it worth it? I mean , is this the American Dream? The CIA, Clinton and friends are damaging the Brand US but perhaps it is not a bad thing‚Ä¶who knows, so much dust we just have to wait till it settles.",2017-01-07 16:35:04,Emmy B
"Yes, good point re Podesta. I have no clue what will happen Trump is a wild card which may actually be a good thing, at the least we can watch the Washington power brokers running around after him which will be highly amusing (if they don-t gag him or worse first).",2017-01-07 16:39:38,LibertarianLibrarian
"He has not held a single political office, what allies may he have in Washington, I don‚Äôt know, the Republicans may be in the end the ones to control him, having Congress and Senate and President a lot can be done, but with such ‚Äòsecure‚Äô environment for passing law, a weak opposition, perhaps we will see fractions within the Republicans playing both government and opposition. When was the last time that all three Con/Sen/Pre belong to the same party, and when are there elections for Congress again?",2017-01-07 16:46:12,Emmy B
"Hmm, not sure last time all 3 in same party, though a lot of Republicans are anti-Trump. So who knows? Congressional terms are 2 years. I think they are staggered so some up every year. Senators are 4 years, and I think staggered as well. Some should be up in 2017, and definitely in 2018, etc. I‚Äôm pretty sure.",2017-01-07 16:55:45,LibertarianLibrarian
"Well if the Democrats get their act together they might stand a chance, but some fresh air will be badly needed they missed their chance with Sanders to bring in some new ideas and re-allignment with what the times require to mobile voters, how long will they be involved in this self-defeating policy of the ‚Äòburnt land‚Äô since they lost.

"Millitaire.gr reports US Admin has requested extended military co-operation btw US GR with focus on upgrading military facilities in the AEGEAN in view of the (now agreed) all NATO offensive on ISIS. A US delegation will visit military facilities in the Aegean. In other articles notes that US interest has been up till now limited and focused on Greece‚Äôs Souda bay with developing US Naval facilities in Crete, now the focus will include other islands too, mentions Turkey‚Äôs unreliability as a partner for a reason, but of course I see an increased US military presence in the Aegean as strategically controlling the straights into Black see and the Russian fleet stationed there, perhaps limiting its involvement in Syria in support of Assad. Reminder that Nato has already been deployed in the Aegean ‚Äòto control refugee flows from Turkey‚Äô albeit obliged Turkey with avoiding South East part as Turkey claims should be de-militarised due to Lozane treatie and other accords (Greece has militarised parts of the aegean since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus).

Greece is a reluctant party and will resist its own military taking any part other than medical/humanitarian as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan but it‚Äôs proximity to the area and the use of it‚Äôs facilities clearly it involves the entire country in the adventurism perils of Western geopolitics.

"In a way is indicative of the role some journalists play being the mouthpiece of government, especially when the government does not have the guts to speak plainly and truthfully about the motives of its actions.

"In Greece US secret services possibly with other collaborators planned an assassination plan (Pythia) against Right-Wing PM Kostas Karamanlis (it links with the 2004-2005 unlawful interception scandal ‚Äì The Athens Affair) due to his re-approachment with Russia. Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don‚Äôt know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the ‚Äòcentre left‚Äô PASOK headed by Clinton‚Äôs friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the ‚ÄòNo‚Äô referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning ‚ÄòPythia‚Äô, at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country. They did it with impunity to Greece why they won‚Äôt do it to America? Perhaps they always did it but were not found out, now everyone can see (not the details of it) but it is so obvious CIA and the rest of them meddle.",2017-07-11 14:22:01,Emmy B

All I got were one liners from the London Mayor! *not happy*,2017-07-19 15:53:32,Emmy B
"Answer 1 ‚Äì The Mayor (13-Jul-2017) As you may be aware there is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it. The MPS will provide a level of resourcing which is proportionate to that offence.",2017-07-19 23:57:07,Emmy B
"Answer 2 ‚Äì The Mayor (13-Jul-2017) Julian Assange is subject to arrest under the Bail Act, for breach of conditions laid by the High Court. This is an operational matter for the MPS who are keeping the situation under review.",2017-07-19 23:57:43,Emmy B
"Answer 3 ‚Äì The Mayor (13-Jul-2017) The allegation that the MPS have spent tens of millions of pounds spying on Julian Assange is incorrect. There is an active warrant issued by Westminster Magistrate Court for failure to appear, and the MPS are obliged to execute it. This is an operational matter for the police who are continuing to review the situation.",2017-07-19 23:58:48,Emmy B
Answer 4 ‚Äì The Mayor (13-Jul-2017) The MPS have not engaged any private police contractors operating in the surrounding streets of the Ecuadorian embassy. Organisations or communities may fund their own security patrols and the MPS will work with personnel in the most appropriate way to prevent and detect crime.,2017-07-19 23:59:30,Emmy B
"Question 4 was ‚Äì David Kurten (13-Jul-2017) Is the Mayor aware of private police contractors operating in Hans Crescent, Basil Street, and surrounding area of Knightsbridge, are they licenced and what is their exact role?",2017-07-20 00:01:07,Emmy B
The answer did not really answer the question so it could be an ‚Äòorganisation‚Äô or ‚Äòcommunity‚Äô exists that employs private police contractors or security patrols. If they Mayor will not disclose how can I find out?,2017-07-20 00:04:11,Emmy B

"In the Aspen Security video that WikiLeaks shared today in its timeline, Pompeo mentions that the name of a CIA agent was published which he found unconscionable, to lukewarm applause, when the interviewer asked him ‚ÄòDo you talk about Phil Agee?‚Äù he says ‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù the interviewer repeats the name and Pompeo says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt know that name‚Äù. Well in his anti-WL speech in April at CSiS https://www.cia.gov/news-information/speeches-testimony/2017-speeches-testimony/pompeo-delivers-remarks-at-csis.html",2017-07-21 06:02:36,Emmy B

Well spotted. He is not referring to Agee but a NYT reporter.,2017-07-21 06:05:09,WikiLeaks
"Embarrassing I thought, some people laughed but probably because they knew who Phillip Agee was. I can understand that perhaps Pompeo was not on best form, but for sure that April speech was not written by him otherwise he would have immediately picked up on the name and say something ‚Äò no not him‚Äô etc. The interviewer made references to his April speech about WikiLeaks earlier in this interview, so, Pompeo surely would have the April speech fresh in his mind, it did not happen a lifetime away. I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep. And perhaps wanting to capitalise on Trump‚Äôs public opposition to Cuba. Trying to pass Trump & his supporters the message that ‚ÄúI love WikiLeaks‚Äù is certainly in the same category/trench as Cuban loving Agee. Who knows.",2017-07-21 06:16:33,Emmy B
