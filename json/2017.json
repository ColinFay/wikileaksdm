Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don‚Äôt know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the ‚Äòcentre left‚Äô PASOK headed by Clinton‚Äôs friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the ‚ÄòNo‚Äô referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning ‚ÄòPythia‚Äô, at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country.

I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep.
