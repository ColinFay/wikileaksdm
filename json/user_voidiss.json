They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now… now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group’s human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is ‘conquering the term’; I mean, real feminism isn’t that “trigger warning”/”rape culture” crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course — as every other conservative/reactionary ideology — has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women’s rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don’t do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you’re indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don’t want to be left out.","date":"2015-10-14 09:34:12","user":"voidiss"},{"text":"And this hyper-sensitivity in colleges, this “microaggression” thing, is slowly building up an environment which should stay in a dystopian book, not in our reality.

And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‘simulation’ of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‘resolution’. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don’t want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‘how things work’ in UN etc. A bit like ‘know the enemy’, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway… today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I’ll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‘delegate’ are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan.

When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into ‘international zone’, therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that – even if the situation are different – this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a ‘frontier zone’ between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there’s an established sovereignty, it’s easy to create ‘grey zones’, make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world’s attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it’s clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too.
