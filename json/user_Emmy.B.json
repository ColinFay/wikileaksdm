It was not actually said as such but this is how it remains in history… as a ‘no you cannot pass your armies into Greece through the Albanian border Mussolini, we shall fight’. Together with the slight distortion of history (the word ‘no’ never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual ‘garment’. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the ‘tribal chief’ of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the ‘greater Macedonia’ claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to ‘liberate’ those historic lands that are currently under foreign control… all this referring to ‘the Greater Macedonian Myth’ created by Bulgarians in the 40’s.

In general women had it tough in a patriarchal society (not to ignore that patriarchy limits mens freedom too not just women’s) but my generation had many more opportunities that ever before which went hand in hand with political developments for the better across society. One here in the UK would laugh to read that some occupational insurance funds in Greece would pay out pensions to unmarried women if their father passed away for example but this was a recognition that ‘in those days’ women could not be financially independent through outside paid work. Other provisions like first born boys of a widow or divorced woman would get reduced time in National Service as they were considered head of the family, i.e. financially providing for their mothers and other dependent members… I mean where do you put such arrangements in the grand literature of feminism?

It was a most brutal dictatorship, thousands tortured as a control, punitive and reformative process, still Greek society continued to function and newspapers continued to operate. Yes there were individual cases of resistance and some efforts for organised revolt in a small scale but nothing in a grand scale. Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy. They were dismayed at the junta’s treasonous effort to overthrow unsuccessfully the democratic government of Cyprus, handing Turkey the premeditated ‘way in’ to invade and partition the island. Having committed in effect National Treason of the greatest degree in opening the door to the brutal enemy’s worst plans, some generals and right wing politicians came to an accord, to bring back Karamanlis, restore democracy in return for impunity for the treason, and impunity for most of the junta’s crimes. I bring this as an example to illustrate the sad fact that Democracy and what it means to our society is only as precious as we give it and the value of its currency is only determined by the action we are prepared to take to keep it safe.","date":"2015-10-29 03:30:25","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Why should we be surprised? a modest life is what most of us aspire to and is reflected in the institutions we make no matter what airs, graces and pretences we put on.

Greece will not participate in any military operation in Syria as part of NATO, its role in the crisis is to remain a stable partner. 2. Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army’s role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can’t see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters.

Focusing on ‘haters’, creating a scandal, contribute in massaging public opinion on how dangerous online hate speech is when right-wingers are involved, singing from the same song sheet that calls for censoring ‘insulting online speech’ after re-defining it as ‘violence online’ pushing public opinion in a certain direction.","date":"2016-03-09 08:21:05","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"*I know* i often thought during the public meeting I went to about the women (and the rest of the individuals) involved with the undercover agents how is it that for Example the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread surveillance or JA’s 24/7 surveillance or WL revelations about surveillance were never mentioned. To me it feels the same political issue of surveillance. The study the organisers did showed that this practice (agents sleeping with the objects of surveillance) went on continuously for a period of 30 years, ie, it proves we are not dealing with isolated cases of rogue agents but of a practice that was propagated by the state actors. One of the lawyers suggested to criminalise for agents to have sex with people they surveill. Still despite the public attention that has been created, the play, the book, the documentary, the public enquiry, why is it that such highly political issue as state surveillance has been kind of de-politicised via its personalisation. Yes, the women who exposed this practice did so in a personal capacity, yes, there might be as a result some responsibility apportioned, some compensation given but it seems to me this is an isolationist approach, a de-politicization, compartmentalised. At a time when in the UK there is the snoopers charter very much in the news, and there are campaigns via ngo’s civil society to push back, at the time when you have Jenny Jones scandalously been surveilled and lied on in FOI request for her files, time when Caroline Lucas legal action proved Wilson doctrine is a puff of air, time when JA surveilled 24/7 at enormous cost etc etc at the time when Trade Unionists expose and push back regarding blacklisting, why is it that all these matters are not unified under the same banner and find a loud political voice in Westminster. So yes, WL statement has various levels, 1. What does it take to create public opinion to react to the Fredriksson scandal? perhaps the personal drama of the women or men he was involved with sexually, even then it might be that society only sees the wrong in his conduct only under the prism of personal betrayal which they will describe as abuse. 2. What does it take for Swedish public opinion to see it is the Swedish state that is behaving in this manner, ie it is a political matter, that Fredriksson deceived, lied and manipulated because it was in his job description, he received a salary for it and he had a performance appraisal at the end of it, all paid for by the Swedish Taxpayer. 3. When does the Swedish public opinion define such behaviour as corruption, ie state surveilance, deception, manipulation is corruption, even in a ‘democracy’.","date":"2016-03-09 08:49:35","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"[Tweet] https://twitter.com/JA_Defence/status/707968011433545729","date":"2016-03-10 08:41:41","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"🙂","date":"2016-03-10 08:41:49","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Our reach out to the Swedish Community in London continues.😃","date":"2016-03-10 08:43:10","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Time for a new banner then 🙂","date":"2016-03-10 08:55:25","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Thank you!","date":"2016-03-11 02:02:39","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"the live streem at Logan is still live we can hear sound engineers btw the symposium and perhaps Ecuadorian embassy? is this wise?","date":"2016-03-11 10:45:31","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"here: https://logancij.com/","date":"2016-03-11 10:46:08","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"guy Hoze says he needs coffee","date":"2016-03-11 10:46:37","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"I can’t believe they are broadcasting this stuff live","date":"2016-03-11 10:47:16","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"hahahaha","date":"2016-03-11 10:48:58","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"‘just make sure you have Julian up and ready…” great !!!???","date":"2016-03-11 10:49:34","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"finally they tuned a musical theme","date":"2016-03-11 11:00:19","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"I know it’s not very lady-like and I shouldn’t but can I just spit on the guy?","date":"2016-03-11 12:46:59","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"We have a name for the 50 pound Heckler, Peter Penfold or Mr Banana http://archive.is/TvgXH","date":"2016-03-11 12:54:19","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"No one asked JA about the quote","date":"2016-03-11 13:05:06","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/708398418071265283/708398418109009921/XEg36p-R.jpg","date":"2016-03-11 13:05:18","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"hahaha x if only I could be a child again I’d give him a black eye hahaha Jenny let’s be pirates – goodnight everyone 🙂","date":"2016-03-11 15:27:09","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Audio https://voicerepublic.com/talks/challenge-power-ii","date":"2016-03-12 10:10:43","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"I missed the Harrison/Colvin/Love session and I don’t see it here archived, let’s hope it will be released later. https://voicerepublic.com/users/the-logan-cij-symposium","date":"2016-03-12 11:11:40","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Here we can listen to several of the speeches: https://voicerepublic.com/users/the-logan-cij-symposium","date":"2016-03-12 12:25:35","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"13 speeches / panel events can be found here.","date":"2016-03-12 12:27:03","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"From History to the future with Speaker: Gavin MacFayden 12th March 2016 | 18:00 – 18:30 McFayhttps://voicerepublic.com/talks/from-history-to-the-future","date":"2016-03-12 12:29:02","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Live call with Edward Snowden 12th March 2016 | 17:15 – 18:00 Snowden addresses the audience in Berlin https://voicerepublic.com/talks/edward-snowden","date":"2016-03-12 12:31:38","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Difficult Targets Speakers: Tim Jenkin, Matt Kennard, Stefania Maurizi, Paul von Ribbeck, and Matthias Spielkamp.

No idea about China. in 1770 (read Orlof) Greeks handed it on the plate, no Russia took what they wanted from Turkey after encouraging insurgency and revolution in Greece as a distraction, then dropped Greeks like a hot potato. In 1917 lost in their own revolution Russia was the first to sign peace treaty with Ataturk prompting the other ‘great powers’ of the time to scram in competition with the other to sign peace treaties with Turkey leaving Greek army in the middle of Anatolia fighting alone, a complete defeat that led to the catastrophic Lozanne treaty of 1923. In Yalta, they sold off Greece outright to the West despite having a very loyal communist led national army on their side. That is why I don’t think they are serious. If only Russia had been more decisive in the Cyprus issue against Turkey perhaps they could have been taken seriously, who knows, but they didn’t. They still could, they don’t.","date":"2016-03-13 11:30:35","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"you mention 1914, well, it reminds me more of 1918.","date":"2016-03-13 11:32:56","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Then in the treaty of Moudros in Lemnos Ottoman Empire was broken up and 2 years later in 1920 The Treatie of Sevres articles 62 and 64 mentioned the creation of Kurdistan.

The problem is not so much the name but the irredentism coming from FYROM with territorial claims and rhetoric identical to the 1940’s Bulgarian Macedonian ‘state’ established by Burgaria in WWII. For those who do not know, Bulgaria was part of the Axis in WWII and one of the three occupying forces in Greece together with Italy and Germany. The Bulgarians were the worst of the three in occupying Greece because they materialised their strategic goal to access to the Aegean Archipelago. During the earlier 20th century Balkan Wars. Greece militarily defeated Bulgaria and so the newly liberated from Ottoman rule became part of Greece. Then there was an agreed exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria as a means to bring ‘stability’ which happened. In WWII Bulgaria as part of axis took the opportunity to be extra brutal as part of ethnic cleansing efforts to annex the area for good. After the war they paid reparations to Greece. That is why the FYROM rhetoric is so difficult to accept. On the surface everyone is talking ‘what’s in a name?’ thinking Greece is unreasonable. But the issue is complex.","date":"2016-03-17 09:01:33","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"No one in Greece is challenging FYROM’s right to sovereignty self rule or borders. The collapse of the Iron curtain was looked favourably at home in the 90’s as finally Greece would be able to trade with its northern neighbours. No one anticipated the irredentism and nationalistic bravado of the past that had dominated early 20th century geopolitics and state formation would be coming back to life as a result of the breakdown of Yugoslavia. 2.5 million of its southern inhabitants declared self rule. Great but why would they chose to alienate 20% of its population that is Albanian (they are not Slavs) by identifying with the Greek Macedonian identity whilst they are not Greek. They claim ancient Macedon was not Greek as if the two are mutually exclusive, a historical ignorance of mammoth proportions “We call greek all those who share our culture” was the definition of Greeks in ancient time (common language, religion, traditions, trading relations) but that world had dozens of kingdoms, city states, islands without formal state structure. Some shared alliances and others fought bitter wars between them. Phillip of Macedon was the first with the ambition to unite all Greeks under his Kingdom and Alexander the Great realised this ambition then went on to conquer other territories, the rest is history. To conclude, you could be a Greek and not a Macedon (eg you could be a Thracian Greek like Thukididis or an Athenian Greek like Pericles, a Spartian Greek like Leonidas) but you could not be a Macedon without being Greek.","date":"2016-03-17 09:34:43","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"apologies for the long rants but you see it all ties in with the geopolitics of our era.

The Turks landed in Alexandroupolis helicopter Blackhawk, (photo from e-evros.gr) hoping that this will escape the consequences of their involvement in the attempted coup against Erdogan. The government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said that the eight arrested accused Turkey of violating the constitutional legitimacy and participation in coup aiming to overthrow democracy and hinted that it will be very difficult not to be extradited. She pointed out that all legal procedures will be adhered to but she stressed twice in a television interview in ERT that the offenses for which they are accused are very serious. The point is a hot potato. An and the decision seems to be one way. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was the first western politician who publicly backed Erdogan and even at the time when it was not clear which side would prevail in Turkey. It is rather difficult now to refuse extradition of eight Turks seven military and a civilian. But because in Turkey they have already begun to seriously discuss the imposition of the death penalty even for some of those involved in the coup attempt, there is an issue!

The situation in Turkey is still not completely under control.","date":"2016-07-16 07:32:49","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"http://www.militaire.gr/%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%81%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%B1-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BE%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%BF-%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%BD-%CE%BE%CE%B7%CE%BB%CF%8E%CE%BD/","date":"2016-07-16 07:33:09","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Good info!","date":"2016-07-16 12:50:37","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/754449148213129219/754449148255010821/R8UG22tM.jpg","date":"2016-07-16 15:54:28","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"had to change password","date":"2016-07-16 15:54:55","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"no","date":"2016-07-16 15:56:16","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"I generally don’t","date":"2016-07-16 15:56:45","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"never happened to me before","date":"2016-07-16 15:57:04","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Thanks h!","date":"2016-07-16 22:25:33","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"Alternative analysis of the failed Turkish Coup attempt presented as pyrihic victory for Erdogan, highlighting Kerry’s presence in Moscow as events unfolded and pointing at developments in Incirlic and US German tensions with the creation of Kurdistan within Turkey as a timely historic event https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=el&u=http://mignatiou.com/2016/07/ke-omos-i-pirrios-niki-tou-tagip-erntogan-prominii-tin-oristiki-ptosi-tou/&prev=search","date":"2016-07-17 01:40:09","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"interesting analysis of coup attempt from kurdish perspective: http://kurdishquestion.com/article/3289","date":"2016-07-17 03:53:36","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"[Card-summary] http://www.i24news.tv/en/news/international/120138-160716-egypt-blocks-un-security-council-from-issuing-statement-condemning-turkey-coup from Egyptian perspective:","date":"2016-07-17 03:56:38","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"As long as Erdogan remains in Istanbul or Constantinople the easier he fits the ‘Sultan image’ and that is to say the last sultan.

I read about what he will speak about, eg Turkey. The latter is very unstable, several politicians currently in gov and outside have been making bold declarations against Greek sovereignty derived by the 1923 Lausanne Treaty. Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal. That Obama chooses to visit is very curious to me. Their influence over IMF and Merkel regarding the debt and its forgiveness (not real forgiveness but a vehicle to manage it to allow some growth) is said to be Obama’s ‘gift’ A lot will be said about the visit, (he will also visit the island of Lesbos) this week, it is an opportunity to tweet WL’s most recent release about Greece and Cables full of the various national security problems described in them including Cyprus.","date":"2016-11-12 14:02:39","user":"Emmy B"},{"text":"The week is not the best for a US presidential visit, on the 17th of November, a national day dedicated to the struggle for democracy when students, workers and others rose up in rebellion in 1973 to oppose the CIA backed junta and were brutally killed. 17 years ago Clinton visited Greece and half apologised for the US role in supporting the junta.

Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don’t know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the ‘centre left’ PASOK headed by Clinton’s friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the ‘No’ referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning ‘Pythia’, at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country.
