The accused is up against a state funded team from the prosecution, another from the police, and, say in JA’s case, another two state funded lawyers for the accusers.","I thought she was a Christian Syriac from (what is now) Turkey, Active within the Syriac Community of Sweden.","A media Lawyer, political connections.","It doesn’t take 5 seconds to see that is an obvious abuse of justice. Imagine it being a black geezer in the States and a white complainant.","In terms of the process and law, there’s only three things the state funded accusers lawyers can do: 1) massage the text of the complaint to ensure it has all the necessay elements to secure a conviction. In Sweden that’s strong, since the “complaint” can always be resubmitted.","2) advice the accuser on how not to be convicted for false reporting, for example, asking for advice about an HIV test rather than making a complaint","3) public relations. For example, nearly all of Borgstrom’s bill was for speaking to journalists. Just for SW he billed for 80 hours of interviews. Normally lawyers do interviews for free, since it is free advertising for them.","So the accusation industry is highly profitable. Almost nothing to do other than bill the state for advertising your own law firm.","Smarmy git","Fritz practice just does accusation work. Hence she’s made a lot of money and expanded rapidly.

Together thay tag-team the accused.","She’s like a fifth rate US TV show","Like Borgstrom and the Quick case in reverse, not really caring for their client in relation to real justice, just focusing on getting a judicial result irrespective of truth","SW’s interests as a person have certainly not been served by such protracted case and her own lawyer campaigning against JA being interviewed in London.","I recall the fritz campaign in early 2014 on the subject to not question JA in London","She played politics not serving justice.","If there is evidence of collaboration between Ny and Fritz, we already know Ny contacted Expressen for a PR stand in London, then where are the 4 pillars of democracy in Sweden?","What a hideous PR firm that is – Ny + Fritz.

But rabid feminists of this sort refuse to listen to anything that counters their ideology, even if it comes from other women.","I just got my ticket to the 9/8 Verso Books event! It’s a nuisance drive into Brooklyn, ~50 miles that will take closer to 2 hours, but worth it!","I don’t even see this as a feminist dialectic issue, once a matter completely veers off the most basic of facts then it is only an opportunity to bully and spit on others as a tool of social exclusion.","When as a child once was asked to offer my chair to my brother as he entered the room so as to sit next to the fire. There was no logic or fact required, reason had nothing to do with it. I had to make space for him and I did. Such articles that I have read JV producing is telling the world there is no space close to the fire for JA, others have to sit there. It is a social exclusion that aims to the physical and intellectual disappearance of the other from a space they wish to dominate.","It is not about the truth or the facts or the protection of others or philosophising about ethics and morals, it is all about complete exclusion from the social/political space that they themselves wish to not just occupy but dominate.","Unfortunately the Guardian has proved again and again that as an organisation wishes to dominate that space by the fire, see the contempt they treat Jeremy Corbyn. But JV may not be a suitable banner bearer, I expect her article to be heavily edited as it would not stand to scrutiny. Her only gravitas will be carrying SW voice, a great shame.","Mrs Fritz cannot have her client’s best interest at heart to be arranging such collaboration, literally throwing her name on the ring of public scrutiny when she knows there is nothing to be gained.","That makes a lot of sense, Emmy. It’s not about the issue itself but their own power and recognition and the ability to push others down. I’ve seen that in many other areas too, it’s just that I’ve had personal run-ins with too many feminists like that. But it can happen anywhere insecure people need attention &amp; domination of others to build up their own self-image.","And there confirms once again the politicisation of the case. I wonder will it be a bit like what MGT attempted to do with the Steinitz journo at the Stern….and having his lawyer giving quotes etc. Let’s see because now, with the AA case dropped and SW case remaining maybe it will be easier to sue for defaming and finally through this lawsuit get access to the MSM messages in the case file, so guarded by Ny?","It is the use of tools of social exclusion (oppression) that are perceived to have been (and be being) used against them. What (as Bella puts it) ‘old-skool feminism’ does is reject those tools altogether. Experience shld be heard and has it’s own legitimate space, and this is of its essence an emotional space – people’s personal narrative is a vital part of the truth. That can be as expressed in as extreme a way as people’s emotions are. It’s the stuff of poetry, memoir, art etc What this stuff does is to place that emotional violence in a journalistic space and ask it to be recognised as objective.","Mrs Fritz has only been out for herself from the start. She’s been somewhat in the background compared to Borgstrom, because of his public profile and history, but now she can get the attention regardless of the impact on her ‘client’.","I think it’s also a fallacy to say that journalism is ‘objective’ except in cases where the evidence is clearly and openly provided, as Wikileaks has sought to do by making all documents available. Yet, even the straight out “x happened” can be shaded by personal bias. That’s a big issue in research and it reminds me of the difference between ‘analytic’ or ‘quantitative’ studies vs qualitative studies, where the latter deliberately explore personal experience and narrative. The issue is that even the best ‘analytic’ research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered. I’d rather see journalists who are capable of recognizing and accounting for their personal biases, willing to minimize those by providing documentary evidence, but without the false pretense of objectivity, as it seems that those who cry the loudest about being objective are usually the most biased.","OK – objective probably not the right word – I just mean analytical","We can’t escape wishing to control the narrative when we write an opinion paper, this is hardly a dialogue it is an opinion wishing to influence. If we see this as a march, who would be persuaded to follow the ambitious lawyer with the glitchy suit, screaming money and success? The emotionally charged journalist who holds the hand of what she presents to the world to be a child but in fact is a fully grown woman. The story is five years old and the march has taken a different direction long time ago. Of course there are interests to be served that push to influence events politically as this case has been politicised. But the more narrow the spectrum they focus on the more evident these become.","M has shared an interesting tweet so we already know who in twitter will jump into the ‘debate’ but there is as per usual no real ‘debate’. The only objective is knock JA/WL down off that cosy space by the fire.","Do we know when the ‘opinion piece’ is coming out? I can’t remember if it’s been discussed already.","We don’t know. Wait and see.","Obviously, the most interesting thing to anyone who isn’t committed to bias already and hasn’t made up their mind what they think, will be SW’s contribution…and that is pretty much a complete unknown I guess","It will not be from the horses mouth though.","How d’you mean?","Yes, it will be interesting to see whether what she says now matches up to those early tweets &amp; texts and how they will attempt to play a change.","You mean her words will be presented to suit the agenda, Em? By Valenti?","well, having seen how Valenti misrepresents a JA’s views (referring to a video as proof when the video disproves her point) as I mentioned above yesterday, when she refered to JA’s interview about Ron /Rand Paul",", Having seen again how in one of her posts she hyperlinks to the guardian article as proof of her claim but when you go to the article you do not find that proof but the opposite","I wonder how much of the SW real views we will get to read for ourselves as a substantial quote or are we just going to be ‘served up’ a fillet cut and tailored to suit JV’s agenda","That kind of disingenuous/sloppy linking/conflating is referred to specifically by several reviewers of her books","or maybe it will be a Q&amp;A where easily a journo can lead the interviewee to say the bits they are looking to hear… hmmm if that is her case with her books then quite possibly we may not get to hear SW’s voice.","If she continues that kind of sloppy misinformation, it certainly gives open room for factual corrections.","Trouble is the detail you have to go into is often in itself a distraction – people lose interest/think you’re being picky","Anyway it could be that it will be the lawyer Fritz transferring SW’s voice as in the case of Borgstom telling the journos what AA said, so she could at any time deny it or become hearsay rather than a testament.","So you select out a couple of obvious examples and then ‘wonder’ about the accuracy of the rest of it. That could very well be, Emmy.","How often we have seen amongst trolls that they take a complete sentence, even a true sentence that someone has wrote, and put it into a context that it appears to be a believable lie. At the Fake forum this has been done constantly. A rule of misinformation if you like. It could be SW’s quotes are also used in this way, we don’t know.","Yeh – sometimes works but pretty hard not to lose pple’s interest being too complex in a tweet. Good point abt hearsay, Em","ie legally","Yes, taking things out of context is a common ploy. How much of that have we seen already? All we can do is try to point to the true context.","And that’s my point about complexity – that sort of deviousness quite effective for reasons I just said. Why I often think sticking to the salient and key factual points best strategy","If V’s piece like Steinitz – who was trying to say JA responsible for/encouraged maligning of women by ‘supporters’ that’s an easy point to refute – why shld he be responsible for that?","True, it is hard to make more complex things clear in tweets or the more simple social media.","Well, we’ll have to see what her piece actually contains and then carefully pick targets, if needed.","I agree! with first point WiseUp and this is all we can do, stick to the facts. Perhaps they will talk about ‘a cult’ again. Also agree with Jenny. But let’s also see how the article will be used in the US, in the UK in Sweden. It will be a starting point for other publications to refer to it and in the process further filter the message to fit the objective. In the UK due to the clear position of the UK government.","(they have accused Ecuador of preventing due process to take place influencing judicial outcome)","Agreed – gotta go cook for 11 of us – ugh","happy cooking xxx","I am unblocking Christine Ann Sands accounts to see what she is up to. Million Mask March @MMMWeekly Sands Sands @SheriffSands","I notice a lot of tweets being directed at Valenti. I’m a bit worried because I don’t want her to be able to claim harassment by JA supporters, especially even before she’s actually published anything.","Yes, it is foolish.

I am asking for advise, maybe rather than just writing a blog post on the matter, myself and others who knew her here in London issue together a press statement for publication. If Sands name is mentioned in the JV article.

Parody wasn’t written recently or in response to this convo, but WLs saying the press constantly snarked at Occupy so they could pin it down to take it down reminded me of some of the lines.

Meanwhile, Appleyard approves of it, which isn’t a good sign (neither is the quote).","It’s not nasty. Starts w him stressing the difference between what he’s been told to expect (a raving lunatic) and how he finds JA (perfectly rational). Which he obviously admires under the circumstances. Nonetheless “interviewing Assange is strange. Damn strange” I’ll bet!! Consider the life-choice disconnect. The piece is kind of ‘languid’, flits about. Probably because he is unfamiliar with/uninterested in the real issues (as in geopolitics/justice/truth etc!). But he doesn’t go on about the Swedish case at all; there’s much more about the US case, which he seems to take at face-value (despite that quote fr Appleyard). So it’s good in that it doesn’t belittle the threat to Assange even saying “he may be right about that” w ref to JA’s conviction that Ny’s delaying tactics are to serve the US timescale, enable them to build their case. The worst thing is, that, apart from a ref to the “horrifying footage” of Collateral Murder, he has no regard for/understanding of the ground-breaking work of WikiLeaks, or JA’s role (so, what’s new?). It ends with the terrible “he’s a hero to many in the land of protest for protest’s sake” after citing who he’s a villain to and why. And it really is like the bloke has landed on an alien planet and is trying to communicate the experience to the normals back home..","Thank you for the summary! If the article is like that, it’s really sad even if it’s not a smearing one. It shows one more time that there are too many people who don’t understand anything about WikiLeaks work, who think about Assange and other involved in this struggle as guys who fight just because they’re a sort of “we’re against everything just to be against” – which is so damn wrong -, or who don’t care about the important revelations at all. And all of this is so disappointing, even if it’s expectable, since many many people even refuse to inform themselves of get interested in these issues. And that’s why WL is so essential anyway.","And regarding Ball’s collaboration with MGT… I’m really curious to see if he will actually prove those documents are true.","highly likely they are genuine. re article, if spin placed over docs discounted, left w/ a completely unremarkable security service assessment detailing concerns any fool could list. the actual issue here is incompetence (every agency’s greatest enemy) – we’re not going to point out the obvious, or add to information already know.","re the assassination thing: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3215122/I-told-whistleblower-Edward-Snowden-escape-Russia-risk-kidnapped-killed-claims-Wikileaks-founder-Assange.html","Wait, so are you making another FOI request to UK regarding assassination threats against Assange?","yes, FOI already published re this matter was sent to Foreign Office, the HO request was sent 4 June.","HO = Home Office","Oh, okay, two FOIAs to two different govt bodies.

We all dream and share your wish for his freedom and try each and everyone of us to do something to help his cause, the WL cause. The Ecuadorian Government has to manage the situation the best way they can continuously for the last three years, under very difficult circumstances. The political leadership of Ecuador remains committed to protect his life, his Human Rights. Despite unprecedented pressures from US Ecuador has found it in their bones to stand up for him. Other Latin American countries support Ecuador’s decision. Other stronger nations like Italy, France, Germany UK, failed to act, even now after all we have learned from WL and Snowden, they still do not act. The world is revealed to us having a very ugly face. Still, it is Ecuador we have to thank for for every day that it passes.","Yes, it’s sometimes confusing, esp. when trying to weed out truth from propaganda. I’m not tremendously surprised that Correa has some bad apples around or that his govt, like any other, is engaged in some surveillance activities. It’s pervasive.

Greenwald made some good comments on it early on — as if there’s a perfect country on Earth to seek asylum in!","On the quite average: there’s no allegation that ecuador has killed a journalist, that any are in prison for journalism, or even, with all the recent protests, that a single person was shot.","Even in relation to Hackingteam, the allegation is that Ecuador had a license to spy on about 16 people concurrently.","Yes, exactly. Sadly, throwing dirt at other people is a very common method of trying to turn attention away from your own abuses.","It hasn’t invaded anyone, bombed anyone, exported weapons to anyone. It’s people are the 3rd happiest in the world, according to Gallap.","Its undoubtedly a democracy and its economy has been growing at double the european average for almost a decade.","Wow, a whole 16 people!

So you get some protests, esp. when the wealthiest sector is hit in their pockets.","Thanks for all this information. Correa’s a representative of a lefties government, so of course it’s very convenient for many people – especially US puppets – make Ecuador seem as a soft of oppressive regime, even when it is not, as the information you tell are showing. It has, of course, many difects and “average abuses” to fix, but not as bas as some try to say – and especially, not as bad as many other countries that instead are considered “perfect libertarian democracies”, i.e. US. And obviously Assange is not responsible for politicians’ decision when it comes to “average abuses”.","I don’t think anyone in their right mind would think of the US as a ‘perfect libertarian democracy’, esp. not those of us who actually are libertarians. 🙁","Oh, well, I’m not referring to informed people! I’m referring also to the image US are trying to show.","I suspect that image is pretty much a total fail at this point. I don’t know a single person who is actually happy with our government, even if we totally disagree on what the government should be doing. But the level of disgust with Washington is extraordinary and I get the sense much of the UK feels similarly.","The problem is turning that disgust into action.","Ecuador has been very good at firing cops. It has fired thousands.","Now that’s something a lot of nations could learn from Ecuador.","Actually, I think the utter failure of the justice system in the US may – finally – be the thing that sets off real, mass, public response.","Bottom-line, we all know Ecuador isn’t perfect, but it has provided some real examples of good, solid leadership and integrity. Goodness knows those are few and far between in today’s world, so well worth celebrating, even despite some imperfections.","I am impressed with the courage and consistency of a small nation finally exercising their sovereignty to improve the welfare of their people, a country that is very poor with a colonial and difficult political past.","My own country, so much better off, but equally small, is instead pre-occupied in de-frauding the state and when caught read handed pass the buck to infinity and beyond, pretending to be the peacock admiring its own feathers.","@wikileaks, may I suggest you share publicly this information about Ecuador? This would help, so who say “WL never talks about Ecuador” should have to shut up, and moreover awareness would increase. But it’s just my opinion…","Anyway, about the US, here in Italy – especially among uninformed and indifferent young people – the feeling of “trust” for US seems still pretty high. I mean, many knows about the black stains of that govt, but despite this they still claim and believe US are a true democracy, one of the best compared to many bad evil ugly African/Asian countries. And it’s shocking how few actually knows the extent of US surveillance despite the Snowden revelations (almost not covered here apart from some journalists).","even the first glimpse of hope in last January’s election has not survived past 7 months.","And yes, I agree with Emmy, at least Ecuador had courage to stand up and also to improve itself. Instead – despite Troika plans were absurd – also Greece had its faults.","WL is not required to defend Ecuadorian politics Greta.","No, of course not! But I think it would be helpful for WL itself, to stop the old criticism “not talking about Ecuador”… But maybe you’re right, it’s not the case.","It might not be bad for ‘us’ to have some facts on Ecuador saved somewhere, though, when someone throws that kind of stuff at us.","I’ve had it happen.","Well it is crystal clear from what MGT tweets that this is exactly the objective of the ones who spit out misinformation, to entangle WL into Ecuadorian internal politics to damage Correa and jeopardise JA’s asylum.","Greta, there are a lot of great things about the US. Our Consitution and Bill of Rights, no matter how abused in present practice, stands for things I believe deeply in and would/will fight for.

Instead, on the political side, they are doing pretty well, no important political agreement/solutions have been reached (quite the opposite, the latest Artic drilling issue shows). They think the solution to everything is more control — or maybe it’s convenient for them to think so.","At the CCCamp there was a talk, “Resisting surveillance”; the main subject of the talk is different from climate change, but a clip made by one of the speaker is linked to this: it’s about a police officer, Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated a environmental activists group and led to the arrest of them all before a planned peaceful action against a coal power plant: https://youtu.be/6eOmj-EUXfU?t=305","The Kennedy talk is excellent","Yes, I agree!

I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the ‘greater Macedonia’ claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to ‘liberate’ those historic lands that are currently under foreign control… all this referring to ‘the Greater Macedonian Myth’ created by Bulgarians in the 40’s. Forgive me the rather long dive into Greek history but I think it says a parallel story.","Whilst in Greece it was the German colonialism that offered the Umbrella for all the land grab, in Syria it is American colonialism.","It is shocking maybe to consider that both democratic and fascist ideologies can produce colonialism","but then you can blame it on the Athenians (the first Democracy)","Democracy in Syria has a future, but as it is at the moment the state may not survive… who knows but let’s take a look at this headline and agree that it could easily be about Syria: https://plus.google.com/113688791849949447824/posts/d858E7XQo9F","‘bairns not bombs’ &amp; Corbyn’s doctrines might finally become the soft language under which a political reality coming home to roost (refugee waves into EU) becomes a foreign policy changer for Syria?","Today is reported that Merkel said the Greeks should do a better job in guarding the EU’s external borders. A little too late, comes the realisation that indeed Greece is a border fortress. But interestingly NATO’s Greek military plan, executed at the cost of the Greek tax payer has been mainly deployed for an eminent USSR attack and not by an attack military or otherwise from any other direction. If the poor dingies can cross from Turkey to the Greek islands so easily, imagine how quickly modern military vessels can cross over and of course they trespass daily, who in EU has ever cared? I do hope that Isis does not spread into Turkey (God forbid they feed the monster, can they control it?) or else ‘island hopping’ the dream of every EU travelling teenager will acquire a very different meaning.","Thank you so much for all these interesting information and thoughts about Syria!

And the reliance of campaigns on how much money they can spend. I, personally, think that there should be limits on how much anyone or any group, whether ‘non-profit’ or ‘profit’ can contribute, and limits on how much candidates can spend. Particularly the latter. We should set a definite limit to campaign spending and apply it to all candidates equally.

I remember in history we mapped out migration moves into the Greek peninsula as the landmarks of one historic period moving into another, moving from Stone Age and pre-history to the times of Writing …Then came the Achaeans with weapons of tin, then came The Ionians with weapons of Copper…Then came the Dorians with weapons of Iron… We forget how natural migration as well as mass migration is in our development. 🙂","@ H, couldn’t quite believe what I was reading in that article but then Self-flagellation is very much accepted in certain cultures albeit in a religious context, maybe it is an indication that this lady’s ideology had become something of a religion for her?","hmmm very medieval in its religiosity but protestant in flavour?","what a maze","I just don’t get how equal rights for women need to be so separate from ‘equal rights for all’ (as often the Proffessor professors).

But I don’t understand such isolanist and naval looking ideas as that article describes. It speaks a kind of psychotic language? Why waste one’s energy in this way instead of let’s say address the many real problems women face around the world still: slavery, mutilation, forced marriages and violence within the context always of HR for all.","but I must dash x","I agree with you Emmy, in the end it must always be framed as equal rights for all. I’ve had a long-standing problem with feminism because it tends towards terrible polemics, hatred, and exclusion of those with differing viewpoints and approaches. Real problems must be addressed, but without playing the blame game.","It all seems very self-important of her to turn her personal problem with drunk behavior into a news story.","I helped the Professor with his asylum rights letter, fixing the English and trying to clean up some of the less clear statements.

I thought it was well written &lt;3 Greek society was very much in flux as I was growing up there, huge differences in attitudes btw city and country for example and from social group to social group. In general women had it tough in a patriarchal society (not to ignore that patriarchy limits mens freedom too not just women’s) but my generation had many more opportunities that ever before which went hand in hand with political developments for the better across society. One here in the UK would laugh to read that some occupational insurance funds in Greece would pay out pensions to unmarried women if their father passed away for example but this was a recognition that ‘in those days’ women could not be financially independent through outside paid work. Other provisions like first born boys of a widow or divorced woman would get reduced time in National Service as they were considered head of the family, i.e. financially providing for their mothers and other dependent members… I mean where do you put such arrangements in the grand literature of feminism? Do we have to permeate every aspect of our social being with ideology? Can’t we just ‘be’?","It’s saddening, deeply saddening. Once innovative and strong movements such as feminism are turning into a doctrine. Feminism started long ago and it was a wave of change… I remember the suffragettes in ‘900, for example; Alice Paul and women’s right to vote in America. They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now… now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group’s human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is ‘conquering the term’; I mean, real feminism isn’t that “trigger warning”/”rape culture” crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course — as every other conservative/reactionary ideology — has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women’s rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don’t do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you’re indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don’t want to be left out.","And this hyper-sensitivity in colleges, this “microaggression” thing, is slowly building up an environment which should stay in a dystopian book, not in our reality. An environment in which everyone must be always kind to everyone, in which everyone must only express accepted views in a group think system and leave out dissenting/radical opinion. And again, all this just helps to value more well-being instead of free speech – expressed with other words, but it’s the same old contrast of security vs freedom so loved by NSA and every govt. Another symptom of this widespread culture which molds people into living and dissolving into their restricted area of comfort, without daring to go out of it, challenge the order. Family, job, money. If they have this, they are happy and all the rest can die in front of their eyes and they won’t see. And hypocritically they keep saying “ah, this world is shit, I’d like to see it change” but then they do nothing to actually change it. “I would but I can’t”.","[Tweet] https://twitter.com/CancilleriaEc/status/654349836100177921 Patino press conference on JA in three hours (9:30pm BST)","Yes, I can remember in college arguing with ‘feminists’ that I had an equal right to choose between a career or staying home and raising kidd and being told I didn’t, that if I chose the latter, I was participating in the patriarchal system, etc. If you don’t accept and parrot their exact ideology, you’re labeled as ‘antifeminist’ which is an insult without real meaning but gets easily thrown at anyone they don’t like. As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid. It also tends towards defining another group as evil by nature not by action, i.e., if you’re male you are automatically bad. This happens often and is why I’ve always hated to identify myself as anything other than an individualist and a humanist. I’ve been supporting Black Lives Matter because the situation is so bad right now, but really, for me, it’s about equal treatment before the law for all. Not special treatment in either direction, but the same. If we should have learned anything from history it is that once rights are stolen from one part of society, the rights of all are at risk and will fall like dominoes.","very true Jenny!","Yes, absolutely agree!","Re ‘feminazis’ (if you will): It seems to have become fanaticism where the in group out bid each other to prove their credentials / commitment, losing sight of what it is that’s trying to be achieved.

Another Ball’s article, again apparently based on internal Ecuadorian documents: http://www.buzzfeed.com/jamesball/revealed-ecuador-thwarted-deal-between-julian-assange-and-sw#.rdaMyvEQO","I see Ball testifying in a court of law one day over his personal role in persecuting JA. Still, all this could actually work in WL’s favour.","For example, @ Hazelpress might find opportunity for a FOI in Sweden based on the leaked document as well as to quiz for the Expressen journo?","Not to mention this gives the perfect opportunity to Correa to ‘clear out’ internal opposition to protecting JA. The anonymous correspondent for example will be known to the gov. The Ball protects his identity could indicate he is aligned to interests represented by Ball within the Ec. gov?","Anyway, every pitfall offers an opportunity and James Ball article reveals more about those interests, and the fact he represents rather than JA.","How can we know that Correa would ‘clear out’ those who said that? How can we know that this isn’t Correa’s thought too? Ball’s article has been done for smearing purpose, yes, it’s very clear, but if those statements are true, how can we know that this isn’t the secret line of the whole Ecuadorian govt? I know that this is precisely Ball’s aim, but if (and only if, since I wouldn’t bet, given that we’re talking about Ball) those documents are true, how can the Ecuadorian govt be trusted anymore? I mean, that Alexis Mera is the legal secretary. I don’t know, I’m quite scared and I don’t know what to think. I mean, we have always known that Ecuador doesn’t agree with WikiLeaks but simply grants JA asylum because of the threats to his human rights, but I would have never imagined they could say something like: “If he fights with us, we will fire him off to jail in Sweden.” But maybe it’s simply Ball who has built up everything just to spread mistrust.","Anyway, the FOI idea would be interesting!","My Dear Greta, this is politics, do not fret.","Ball’s article will be more helpful than he thinks 🙂","If I am very mistaken, it will prompt Marianne Ny to make another statement. The more she talks the better 🙂","It is also embarassing to the Swedish Justice ministry. None of these details are new.","But Sweden now knows that its correspondence is also beein leaked. This is a good thing.","The question to ask Ball if you want is, whether he has cross checked with the Swedish Prosecution or Swedish Ministry that the Swedish docs are genuine. Or whether he has contacted them for a comment.","As I read he has not. Why not. Also, has he contacted the UK correspondent of the Swedes again for verification.","The document’s dates corroborates what I read at the time that Sweden acted in a sloppy and political manner uninterested in real progress.","Yes, worth asking him these things, you’re right — and if he hasn’t contacted anyone from Sweden, how he has verified that the documents are true, if he has. Also, it’s worth noting that he always puts only the beginning of the “leaked docs” in the article, for example just a little bit of the Ny email. Why doesn’t he put it in complete form? Is there something in the rest of email that doesn’t play his game?","I bet you this article has Marianne Ny sweating, what other of her correspondence will become public?","I love how he included in the screenshot the Swedish Ministry’s correspondence reference number, so helpful for any FOI 🙂 and the date, the date!!!! five weeks before the statue of limitation been reached. Not very efficient, are they?","Plus, a FOI can ask for the serial documents before and after to see any relating correspondence with other departments before or after this particular one.","extremely interesting how the Ny e-mail has the middle name in CC blanked out but let the other two Ingrid and Karin visible. Hmmm something comes to mind… let me check…","see here: http://rixstep.com/2/20151012,00.shtml","[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/654697858944241667/654697859225292800/l8I6H_Ky.png","JA MRI story is not appearing in Swedish media, of course. Never underestimate the ability of that culture to ‘play the Swede’.","If cecilia was the name that was redacted why was it redacted?","@ WL yes but it will be eventually, neutralised when it is no longer ‘the news’.","Hope JA finds comfort for his shoulder. If it is muscle pain, maybe heat patches might help.","Was June the 8th the very first time Ny contacted the Embassy? and only after Nicola Yang suggested it? how embarrassing!","Wait! Regarding the Ny’s e-mail we still know nothing, but now that I’ve checked, about the Swedish Ministry doc there’s no need for a FOIA, we already have the correspondence of that period and even Ecuador’s response (which is in Swedish, however) to that precise statement: http://filebin.ca/2Bf3xwK4Rkho/Appendix2.pdf","Re MRI, yes… Swedish media are showing their nature once more, censorship over censorship. There’s only The Local Sweden: http://www.thelocal.se/20151015/ecuador-grant-julian-assange-safe-passage","Thanks Greta, a lot to go through though, will take time to read.","So, why does Ball recycle all this stuff?","These come from a FOIA, anyone can obtain them, so I don’t know, probably he simply used them to corroborate and put more ‘substance’ in its article. He uses only a selected part of them, only the Swedish Ministry statement, without including Ecuador’s response or further correspondence, so probably he just needed that bit to play his game, his “Ecuador stalled the proceedings” line.","WL did you get that message earlier re acupuncture etc?","@WL – TT picked up MRI story and it got published in SvD. Yesterday, I think. http://www.svd.se/ingen-fri-lejd-for-assange","I hope JA feels better soon! They should be able to bring in portable x-ray and ultrasound machines. Not as good as MRI for soft tissues but definitely a start to rule things out.","For anything musklculoskeletal, rest, ice, compression, elevation (RICE) with anti-inflammatory meds is the starting place. It would be awful if he does need surgery. Maybe that will finally push the issue on Sweden and the UK.","Ball is an ass.

It was a most brutal dictatorship, thousands tortured as a control, punitive and reformative process, still Greek society continued to function and newspapers continued to operate. Yes there were individual cases of resistance and some efforts for organised revolt in a small scale but nothing in a grand scale. Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy. They were dismayed at the junta’s treasonous effort to overthrow unsuccessfully the democratic government of Cyprus, handing Turkey the premeditated ‘way in’ to invade and partition the island. Having committed in effect National Treason of the greatest degree in opening the door to the brutal enemy’s worst plans, some generals and right wing politicians came to an accord, to bring back Karamanlis, restore democracy in return for impunity for the treason, and impunity for most of the junta’s crimes.

Greece will not participate in any military operation in Syria as part of NATO, its role in the crisis is to remain a stable partner. 2. Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army’s role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can’t see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters. In Turkish waters are invisible and suddenly in Greek waters are visible?","Greek Navy is not involved in the operations currently but Turks will bring them in (remember they do what they like their navy already trespasses frequently and forces the Greek navy and airforce to be shadowing them around). If Turkish navy get’s an in then Greek Navy is forced to participate, then the scene is set for skirmishes and red alert tensions on a daily bases btw Turkish/Greek vessels. If anyone thinks all this has anything to do with saving refugees they can think again, consider what we are dealing with: 1. desperate people 2. ruthless traffickers 3. flimsy dingies. Why, if military vessel as much as approach one of these dinghies the waves they makes might just topple the dingy, not to mention that Traffickers advise refugees that the moment they see the coast guard to sink the dingy so then coast guard is forced to launch a saving operation rather than toe them back to the sea border and co-ordinate with Turkish coast guard to pick them up (this used to happen a lot where some small vessels were forced to return to Turkey) With the weather deteriorating from week to week the death toll increases, the journey is even more perilous.","Ah surprise surprise! ‘US launches attack on hundreds of Daesh oil trucks in Syria’ http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/11/16/437855/US-attacks-Daesh-trucks-Syria","[Tweet] https://twitter.com/greekemmy/status/665638945988980737 from 2 days ago:","(article has nice photo of Carl Bildt masterminder of disastrous EU policy of helping the rebels finances by getting rid of oil trading restrictions.

As Greece declared to intervene, Turkey responded that this would be cause of war. The tension calmed down later with mediation efforts of NATO and the USA.”), Imagine going down to the supermarket on an errant to find the shelves empty from panic buying… the threat was as is now real. At the same time I remember both the activities of the 17th of November dominating the headlines, the activities of Mossad against the Palestinians and the police brutality in marches etc still, all these threats never became a reason to hold societal progress in the 80’s and 90’s which was unstoppable.","Such terror has little currency in Greece as a means of population control in a country with deep knowledge of conflict of war, real hardship and political persecution, concentration camps, juntas etc so recent in its history.","I think this hysteria is very much driven by political powers for their own benefit, it is not society driven.","Unfortunately Clinton has the power to fool, just like Obama, her sheep’s skin completely disguises her nature.

But I doubt that. Personally, I’m more afraid of Hillary than anyone else. Some of the Rep candidates are repulsive but the system will keep them under its control. Hillary is too much in control of the controllers and, as WL said, she’s a sadistic sociopath. She’ll happily do what the PTB want. Some of the Republicans are nuts but that’ll get shut down. They’ll be a puppet like Obama. I am so scared of what’s happening to my beloved America. Just terrified.","Jenny, it is a large country and there will be pockets of liberality or places where local politics define life to a greater extend rather than Federal politics?","Exactly. Obama is just a centralizer. He’s bad because representionally he does not look or act like that which he represents. Hillary has similar representation confusion, but she will actively lead the machine to a dark place.","@ h agree. From outside looking in US has done it all, after world war II it has done it all, the torture, the foreign dictators, the Vietnams, Iraqs, Afghanistans… @ WL yes, it like having Psaki with a string of pearls deliver gov answers and policy of the most ruthless kind, but smiling and being altogether sweet. Horribly deceptive.","GOP will generate a lot oposition, including through dumb moves. Hillary will do the same thing, but co-opt the liberal opposition and the GOP opposition.","Hence hillary has greater freedom to start wars than the GOP and has the will to do so.","What would be the thing that will bring her down? (we know that for the US electorate foreign policy may not be as influential) From the internal political agenda, what policy would bring her down?","What type of corruption would be the one that make her unelectable? financial fraud perhaps? or has she been involved in undermining the campaign of a fellow Democrat through dirty tricks?","But if she has spent years developing clients within every fraction of her party it is unlikely that they will disown her now.","He role in the war in Libya is what should bring her down, however, the GOP is too close to others who have benefited to exploit this, it seems. That Hillary helped to sew the foundation for ISIS against pentagon generals advice seems huge.","But the GOP resolutely ignores it.","Hillary has so muc hslime on her shirt it is now hard to make dirt stick.","I think far more Americans are against Hillary than anyone realizes because the mass media is in her pocket. She’s going to fail in most of the large geographical areas, but they’re less populated, so you get the east/west coast population centers behind her and the rest of the country not.","And Sanders could surprise her.

Let’s hope they’re serious about it this time…","I’m doing a thing I’d like to share with you all… This year my school offered the partecipation in a project called NHSMUN (National High School Model United Nation), that is a big project initially created by IMUNA and organized by different associated orgs in each country (like Italian Diplomatic Academy in Italy). And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‘simulation’ of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‘resolution’. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don’t want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‘how things work’ in UN etc. A bit like ‘know the enemy’, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway… today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I’ll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‘delegate’ are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan. So, that is, I just wanted to let you all know about this thing because I think it’s going to be interesting. I will share more about it! 🙂","Neat. Not sure about the course, but model UN is mostly for hookups though.","Well done Greta, a great achievement to get on the course in the first place x you will learn a ton of things and good debates coming up! keep us up with whats up and see if there is a Cable or two that you may be able to quote in your analysis 😉","Yes, they presented it as a good opportunity for hookups too, a way to bring young people closer to the diplomatic environment: in New York there will even be some orientation lectures about this specific post-high school path. But well, I can simply ignore this part and take the good parts of the project.","Thanks, Emmy! And yes, WL search engine is the first thing I thought about when they told me about doing research on those topics! 😀","Need an advice… If one has to buy a new phone, what’s better between Android and iOS?","B/c Android has more privacy-related apps but Google has its well-known spying policy; Apple has fewer apps but perhaps it is less NSA-like.","Not a tech person, I consider everything compromised, and even after all the crypto parties I’ve gone to there is a certain resignation on my part regarding the matter, Still, if you have the money a Black phone seems to be a good starting point, they use https://www.silentcircle.com/products-and-solutions/devices/","“Only Blackphone runs on Silent OS, an enhanced Android operating system that delivers privacy without compromise.”","But you will have to be quite determined to improve the safety of your communications.

What would that motive be? a. generally snoop around and collect personal info as well as dirt on ppl that SAPO could lean on for political and other influence. b. create a name for his organisation for protecting privacy (!!!??? preposterous I know) and protecting the vulnerable. c. Focusing on ‘haters’, creating a scandal, contribute in massaging public opinion on how dangerous online hate speech is when right-wingers are involved, singing from the same song sheet that calls for censoring ‘insulting online speech’ after re-defining it as ‘violence online’ pushing public opinion in a certain direction.","what we need is women who slept with him to come forward and say they were raped because they did not consent to sleeping with a sapo agent","[Tweet] https://twitter.com/TomZdechovskyEP/status/707502470898049025","*I know* i often thought during the public meeting I went to about the women (and the rest of the individuals) involved with the undercover agents how is it that for Example the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread surveillance or JA’s 24/7 surveillance or WL revelations about surveillance were never mentioned. To me it feels the same political issue of surveillance. The study the organisers did showed that this practice (agents sleeping with the objects of surveillance) went on continuously for a period of 30 years, ie, it proves we are not dealing with isolated cases of rogue agents but of a practice that was propagated by the state actors. One of the lawyers suggested to criminalise for agents to have sex with people they surveill. Still despite the public attention that has been created, the play, the book, the documentary, the public enquiry, why is it that such highly political issue as state surveillance has been kind of de-politicised via its personalisation. Yes, the women who exposed this practice did so in a personal capacity, yes, there might be as a result some responsibility apportioned, some compensation given but it seems to me this is an isolationist approach, a de-politicization, compartmentalised. At a time when in the UK there is the snoopers charter very much in the news, and there are campaigns via ngo’s civil society to push back, at the time when you have Jenny Jones scandalously been surveilled and lied on in FOI request for her files, time when Caroline Lucas legal action proved Wilson doctrine is a puff of air, time when JA surveilled 24/7 at enormous cost etc etc at the time when Trade Unionists expose and push back regarding blacklisting, why is it that all these matters are not unified under the same banner and find a loud political voice in Westminster. So yes, WL statement has various levels, 1. What does it take to create public opinion to react to the Fredriksson scandal? perhaps the personal drama of the women or men he was involved with sexually, even then it might be that society only sees the wrong in his conduct only under the prism of personal betrayal which they will describe as abuse. 2. What does it take for Swedish public opinion to see it is the Swedish state that is behaving in this manner, ie it is a political matter, that Fredriksson deceived, lied and manipulated because it was in his job description, he received a salary for it and he had a performance appraisal at the end of it, all paid for by the Swedish Taxpayer. 3. When does the Swedish public opinion define such behaviour as corruption, ie state surveilance, deception, manipulation is corruption, even in a ‘democracy’.","[Tweet] https://twitter.com/jonfitchdotnet/status/707617887855386624 Hah.

And looking forwards to more videos/audios from Logan as they come out. Greta, great news looking forward to your comments of the events xxx","I forwarded S Hersh commentary on Syria to militaire, new greek national defence website, they immediately published it, his views, always valuable will reach an audience, the Greek military which views with alarm Nato activity in the Aegean, Turkeys bazar style bargaining with Nato and EU and a civil administration in Greece captured by the financial strangulation and the creditors demands.","If civil admin loses the confidence of the army Greece will go back to darkest days. Will the politicians left and right finally break through and effectively manage the crisis?","Greek title over the Islands close to Turkey are not sustainable from a military perspective","Turkey is going to continue to harress them until Greece gives way, which it will.","Unlikely to be a formal hander over, but Greece will have to make an informal concession at some stage.","Such a view is abhorrent. Last time US auctioned off Hellenic land to Turkey with the assistance of UK and Israel it took a military regime in Greece to act as their willing pawn.","The military regime was enabled because of internal political instability festered for decades by the greek palace. This factor is absent from Greek politics since 1974.","Turkey the aggressor has been indeed emboldened by the impunity they enjoyed 40 yrs on on Cyprus invasion and occupation. What perhaps is not understood in the West is that the ambitions are not just half the Aegean. For why should Turkey establish a naval vase in Albania?","I leave the conversation here 🙂","But here is what happened in the region not that long ago http://www.britannica.com/topic/Balkan-Wars","This kind of slow, silent expansionism that we see in the Aegan makes me think that ‘neutral zones’ have no chance of survival in this world, because the most powerful country in question would surely find a way to slowly overcome the ‘neutral’ barrier. When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into ‘international zone’, therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that – even if the situation are different – this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a ‘frontier zone’ between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there’s an established sovereignty, it’s easy to create ‘grey zones’, make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world’s attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it’s clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too. Plus, if we consider that the external superpowers will help the powerful country in question (as NATO with Turkey, more or less), neutral zones can be nothing but facades.","Emmy, it is not fair, but unless Greece installs Russian or Chinese bases on those Islands or something equally bold it is going to lose them bar Turkey being seriously weakened elsewhere.","Strategically it should make a settlement at the moment Turkey is weak and Greece is strong. But that won’t happen due to Greece’s political structure. So the settelment will come when Greece is at its weakest and Turkey is at its strongest.","Erodgan and company are intent on going back to pre-1914 borders as much as possible.","Russia has never been serious neither will they be now. No idea about China. in 1770 (read Orlof) Greeks handed it on the plate, no Russia took what they wanted from Turkey after encouraging insurgency and revolution in Greece as a distraction, then dropped Greeks like a hot potato. In 1917 lost in their own revolution Russia was the first to sign peace treaty with Ataturk prompting the other ‘great powers’ of the time to scram in competition with the other to sign peace treaties with Turkey leaving Greek army in the middle of Anatolia fighting alone, a complete defeat that led to the catastrophic Lozanne treaty of 1923. In Yalta, they sold off Greece outright to the West despite having a very loyal communist led national army on their side. That is why I don’t think they are serious. If only Russia had been more decisive in the Cyprus issue against Turkey perhaps they could have been taken seriously, who knows, but they didn’t. They still could, they don’t.","you mention 1914, well, it reminds me more of 1918.","Then in the treaty of Moudros in Lemnos Ottoman Empire was broken up and 2 years later in 1920 The Treatie of Sevres articles 62 and 64 mentioned the creation of Kurdistan. Soon after the allies peace making and the defeat of the greek army meant there was no one to make the new Turkey comply with such articles. The Kurdish issue has reached certain maturity today. We are watching what will Russia will do, will they be successful in getting the Kurds to sit around the table at the UN peace negotiations for Syria? Will they clench the deal for a Syrian Kurdish state? They have invited Dimitras (Kurds in Turkey) to open offices in Moscow, will they follow through or will they damp them once they get what they want in Syria?","[Media-image] https://ton.twitter.com/1.1/ton/data/dm/709095691256274948/709095691289804800/hB8_opTP.jpg Re the hourglass sculpture, I’m thinking it must be this one at Berlin, Admiralstrasse 1. https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8078/8329798148_29757d14d0_b.jpg","regarding the comic injust read https://voluntaryists.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/the-voluntaryists-versus-the-nsa-saving-snowden-release-pdf.pdf","In part 1 ‘Saving Snowden’ the superheroes are fighting Putin and smuggle him to Ecuador !!!","hmmm","From a review of Showtime’s “Dark Net”: “The first story here is that of open-source guns being made through 3D-printing (described as the “Wikileaks” of weapons).” http://www.tvovermind.com/review/dark-net-season-finale-review-revolt","[Tweet] https://twitter.com/NortonAU/status/709226070881517569 Haha, what?!

Junior gov partner ‘Independent Greeks’ convened a meeting and decided to support the government but they demand Refugee petty minister muzalas resignation over his error to call FYROM ‘Macedonia’ in public.","Everyone is calling FYROM Macedonia, he got carried away and made a simple mistake for which he has apologised. The problem is not so much the name but the irredentism coming from FYROM with territorial claims and rhetoric identical to the 1940’s Bulgarian Macedonian ‘state’ established by Burgaria in WWII. For those who do not know, Bulgaria was part of the Axis in WWII and one of the three occupying forces in Greece together with Italy and Germany. The Bulgarians were the worst of the three in occupying Greece because they materialised their strategic goal to access to the Aegean Archipelago. During the earlier 20th century Balkan Wars. Greece militarily defeated Bulgaria and so the newly liberated from Ottoman rule became part of Greece. Then there was an agreed exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria as a means to bring ‘stability’ which happened. In WWII Bulgaria as part of axis took the opportunity to be extra brutal as part of ethnic cleansing efforts to annex the area for good. After the war they paid reparations to Greece. That is why the FYROM rhetoric is so difficult to accept. On the surface everyone is talking ‘what’s in a name?’ thinking Greece is unreasonable. But the issue is complex.","No one in Greece is challenging FYROM’s right to sovereignty self rule or borders. The collapse of the Iron curtain was looked favourably at home in the 90’s as finally Greece would be able to trade with its northern neighbours. No one anticipated the irredentism and nationalistic bravado of the past that had dominated early 20th century geopolitics and state formation would be coming back to life as a result of the breakdown of Yugoslavia. 2.5 million of its southern inhabitants declared self rule. Great but why would they chose to alienate 20% of its population that is Albanian (they are not Slavs) by identifying with the Greek Macedonian identity whilst they are not Greek. They claim ancient Macedon was not Greek as if the two are mutually exclusive, a historical ignorance of mammoth proportions “We call greek all those who share our culture” was the definition of Greeks in ancient time (common language, religion, traditions, trading relations) but that world had dozens of kingdoms, city states, islands without formal state structure. Some shared alliances and others fought bitter wars between them. Phillip of Macedon was the first with the ambition to unite all Greeks under his Kingdom and Alexander the Great realised this ambition then went on to conquer other territories, the rest is history. To conclude, you could be a Greek and not a Macedon (eg you could be a Thracian Greek like Thukididis or an Athenian Greek like Pericles, a Spartian Greek like Leonidas) but you could not be a Macedon without being Greek.","apologies for the long rants but you see it all ties in with the geopolitics of our era. I will put some links here in case anyone would like to read the issues. Could this issue bring down the government? Well I don’t think the minority party ‘Independent Greeks’ would make such a fuss if it was not important for their long term electoral survival. On the other hand it shows the pressures this government is under when practically nothing goes its way.

A lot of ‘leaderless’ rhetoric is psycological cover for people who are very concerned about power gradients. This sensitivity to power can come from a desire not to be bossed around, but it can also come from another place. The first step to power is to stop others having power over you. The second step is to have power over others. In this case there are key assets such as twitter and the domain registration. Someone has these credentials and whoever does can exercise their person whims.","personal.","Twitter, DNS, bank accounts etc, in this way create power problems, turning ‘leaderless’ movements into FBI movements, e.g Sabu.","m, we don’t mind the aesthetic. It’s clear based on presentation this is not going to appeal to the middle class, but rather the lumpen prolitariat and teenagers. That’s OK, since it is hard to have a campaign that appeals to both.","Actually, the campaign should recognise that constraint and seek to use it to its advantage.","In the case of AKAWKA these key assets, once developed though our “support”, were then exploited by castro to wage a personal vendetta on JA to demonstrate her leverage. As leverage increases people expect concessions from us. We can’t be in that position.","So what could be the strategy to avoid this centralization of key assets? Creating separate groups with some active #JA4me supporters and feed that channel in case of a ‘gone rogue’ eventuality? The management of the Twitter account is going to rotate, it’s a good sign…","Good thought, Greta. We just need to keep an eye on them and watch for signs of power-hungry personalities. Try to head then off and encourage the better aspects.","Considering I swallowed MGT’s lies hook line and sinker for a considerable time, and did his bidding for x number of months all in the name of supporting WL/JA I don’t think I am the best judge, in fact, many of us were deceived, so I am taking WL concerns raised here seriously I really need to look into this properly.

Twitter has suspended MGT’s account once in 2014 and another time in Sep 2015 in response to Chris’s complaints.

That is to say, if an account remains de-activated for certain amount of time then the handle becomes available again to be used by another user (you may not be aware but this is what happened to Christine Assange’s original account, when she abandoned it, it was eventually picked up by MGT or his friends and used as a harassing account, and it is now on my list of troll accounts recommended for blocking) By becoming suspended he is in permanent limbo, being inactive but without the risk of losing the handle. As the twitter account is certainly in the midst of Chris’s case against MGT, ultimately what we observe happening to it, reflects directly the outcome of the legal case and how MGT wishes to maneuver himself legally.","@ M thanks for all the wonderful resources.","Thanks Em.

The government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said that the eight arrested accused Turkey of violating the constitutional legitimacy and participation in coup aiming to overthrow democracy and hinted that it will be very difficult not to be extradited. She pointed out that all legal procedures will be adhered to but she stressed twice in a television interview in ERT that the offenses for which they are accused are very serious. The point is a hot potato. An and the decision seems to be one way. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was the first western politician who publicly backed Erdogan and even at the time when it was not clear which side would prevail in Turkey. It is rather difficult now to refuse extradition of eight Turks seven military and a civilian. But because in Turkey they have already begun to seriously discuss the imposition of the death penalty even for some of those involved in the coup attempt, there is an issue! The EU does not “cover” us to extradite defendants in countries that may condemn them to death. Militaire.gr sources indicate that there is communication between Athens and NATO, in order to manage the issue.”","http://www.militaire.gr/%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF-%CF%84%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C-%CE%AC%CF%83%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%BF-%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%8D%CE%BD-%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CF%84/","The military arrested across Turkey after the coup attempt amounted to 1,563, an official said. The issue is not only the number involved. The issue is who did Erdogan ‘unwrap’. ▪I Turkey has captured fighter pilots, Commanders Special Forces amphibious force, and also the Governor of the landing craft of the Aegean fleet. ▪O Erdogan “removes teeth” from throughout the administration of the Aegean fleet on the basic accusation that they attempted to kill him. ▪Also it is not the army that performs the arrests in the army but the anti-terrorist service, this shows how problematic the situation is.

One has to ask why he does not return to his seat of government, Ankara, Perhaps he has actually been de-throned and prefers to be near the exit, the millions who’ve followed the path before him into Europe for safety, let us see whether there will be a helicopter available to take him to safety when the time comes and what will be its nationality.","Thousands attend/ed Gulen schools and associations are they all going to be targeted by Turkish state?

I have no idea if indeed Gulen had anything to do with the plot, or his sympathisers did, how could I, but Erdogan has marked them as his enemy and so it is. The Gulenist supporters sympathisers, if we believe the US embassy cables as an accurate source is into millions within Turkey, imagine how many have gone to the schools, have been in Gulenist trade associations or charities, Erdogan paints with the brush of terrorists a very large part of the population, it is extraordinary how he chose to act with purging thousands from positions of state, in the legal,judicial profession, the army, the police, kind of disintegrating the state and terrorising a huge part of the state apparatus and the population, introducing a chaos element within his own ranks. The enemy within, instead of ‘The Kurds’, ‘The Greeks’ ‘The Armenians’ ‘The Laz’ . I wonder how he can sustain this in the medium or long term. I get the feeling things are very much in flux. Neither can we assume that the external powers to be are currently idle. Considering the importance of Turkey militarily, Erdogan is now a liability for them too, I don’t know why Egypt comes to mind, perhaps because they were the only ones in UN not to condemn the coup attempt.","it is a complex situation hopefully the new release will help many to understand the situation and in fact, calm things down","it may also offer distraction and focus minds","at the mo everything is frozen by violence or the threat of violence","Listing Gulen as a terrorist group a month ago would have put many in a dangerous position.","So coup could be gulen related.","it is inevitable, event if he himself does not pull the strings, the thousands associated with the movement have been active state actors for years, in fact they were for years Erdogan’s power base supporting his rise to power, as per US Embassy cables","it is just the scale of Erdogan’s intention to criminalise potentially hundreds of thousand of people… on the other hand, Kurds have been at the receiving end of such discrimination for decades upon decades, previously Armenians, Greeks ethnically cleansed so society it seems is willing to accept such mass scale criminalisation of groups of people? but difficult to understand really what is happening. Trying to make parallels with other countries… de-baathification perhaps in Iraq, but it was done by an external occupying force, or the exclusion from power of Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt… but again it is different.","Please be careful &lt;3","LOL!!!

There is real deep fear for satan/occult practices (I am given talismans every time I go to Greece for perceived protection of me and the kids from the evil eye/satan and all sorts) among Christians as this is a major pre-occupation of organised religion.","let’s not forget the origin of the term ‘witch hunt’","[Tweet] https://twitter.com/snopes/status/794657572754247684","when I say the fear is real, I will also put some context, early Christians were accused of drinking blood and practising cannibalism etc (holy communion misunderstood)","it is a can of worms as well as the stuff of comic strips","Right. The term comes from persecuting people based on ridiculous notions. So the hypothesis that Podesta participated in Satanic rituals should not be pushed because it distracts from his actual corrupt practices.","I am not saying that Podesta did anything like that. Still, the fear is real among Christian communities since, let’s face it, organised religion has a lot of rituals that are controlled by priests but if they are performed by lay people, it is taboo, shocking. I am not familiar with the artist in question but the theme plays to the darkest fears and instincts of people.","It’s certainly not as important as the obvious corruption, but it symbolic of the attitude of these people who think they can do anything and get away with it. In that sense, only, it’s worth noting.","PS in Greece, very much dominated by a Christian culture there are often scandals about satanists or occult practices, and people tremble. There is belief in the ‘evil eye’, reading the future in coffee cups, and sometimes one wonders where religion ends and magic begins as it gets blurry. 🙂 but in a set beliefs which accepts miracles and supernatural power like Christian communities do, there is also a recognition that evil powers exist represented by Satan, at a mild modern context the yin and yang but for organised church as well as people who believe, this is real. In our modern world we demand rationality above all in public office rather any sort of mumbo-jumbo although let’s not forget her ‘majesty the queen’ is also head of the church of England :-p for Podesta this story is bad news.","Another of the emails confirms that John Podesta didn’t go https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/25325","true, but ‘Marina missed you’ implies familiarity ie they might know each other quite well.

Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal. That Obama chooses to visit is very curious to me.

Regarding the attempted break-in at the Embassy, I am assured that the MPS continually assess the security arrangements of all diplomatic premises in London. Clearly, it would not be appropriate to detail these publicly.”","I note that the Mayors reply focuses on the EAW and not on ‘he broke his bail’ mantra.","Further to recent correspondence I have had with Mr Kurten, he writes that he shares my concerns about the welfare of Mr Assange and he has tabled this week a further question to the Mayor and I quote: “asking if he will seek to recover the operating costs from the Swedish government, considering that he has just invoiced Volkswagen for costs relating to the Congestion Charge due to the emissions scandal”, I will monitor the website for any updates on the matter.","The next Question to the Mayor session will be on Wed 14th of December but it could very well be that an answer will not be forthcoming till much later, in a written format in the new year.","Ace question there from Mr. Kurten.

When was the last time that all three Con/Sen/Pre belong to the same party, and when are there elections for Congress again?","Hmm, not sure last time all 3 in same party, though a lot of Republicans are anti-Trump. So who knows? Congressional terms are 2 years. I think they are staggered so some up every year. Senators are 4 years, and I think staggered as well.

Reminder that Nato has already been deployed in the Aegean ‘to control refugee flows from Turkey’ albeit obliged Turkey with avoiding South East part as Turkey claims should be de-militarised due to Lozane treatie and other accords (Greece has militarised parts of the aegean since the 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus).

Of course Trump politically is very rightwing, not of my persuasion, but what we see here is the cancelling of politics, when CIA is in cahoots with the Democrat &amp; Republican establishment to get rid of Trump. Imagine what they must have threatened Obama with… we’ll never know.","Keep saying it, but interesting times.","Seems like some on-going battles /struggles around Trump circle.","In Greece US secret services possibly with other collaborators planned an assassination plan (Pythia) against Right-Wing PM Kostas Karamanlis (it links with the 2004-2005 unlawful interception scandal – The Athens Affair) due to his re-approachment with Russia. Whether they intended to carry it out or they just did it to intimidate, we don’t know but it worked, he resigned after only 2 years in government. The following government of the ‘centre left’ PASOK headed by Clinton’s friend George Papandreou brought the Troika and IMF in spectacularly failing to manage the crisis and he resigned also after 2 years to hand over to a buraucratic coallition gov that lasted 9 months or so, then the right wing party of New Democracy headed by Samaras got elected, ex housemate of George Papandreou in US when they were both studying there, who also governed 2 and a half years till Syriza was elected in January 2015, then we had the ‘No’ referendum, then elections again in Sep 2015. Why I am saying all this? Yes the crisis and effective bankrupsy was the primary reason of the political instability but the complete failure of the political world to deal with the crisis, the rise of the Golden Dawn, points to an assault on democratic sovereignty that its beginning lies in US deep state destabilisation efforts during the Karamanlis government, first with the scandal of the unlawful interception of at least 150 people in government politics and the economy and then planning ‘Pythia’, at least as an assassination threat on Karamanlis if not the actual thing. With a country like Greece with fresh memories of brutal repression (Junta 67-74) etc etc, introducing such destabilisation is crippling to the political world as they do not have confidence they can actually govern the country. They did it with impunity to Greece why they won’t do it to America? Perhaps they always did it but were not found out, now everyone can see (not the details of it) but it is so obvious CIA and the rest of them meddle.","interesting","Quite the claim!

I guess someone else put Agee in there in the speech as a WikiLeaks/whistleblower equivalent from the past, from during the cold war when the trenches were clear cut and deep.
