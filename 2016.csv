Fritz has a statement in the metro in Sweden. We can see no reference to SW saying anything there and are suspicious. There are three possibilities 1.

"*I know* i often thought during the public meeting I went to about the women (and the rest of the individuals) involved with the undercover agents how is it that for Example the Edward Snowden revelations of widespread surveillance or JA‚Äôs 24/7 surveillance or WL revelations about surveillance were never mentioned. To me it feels the same political issue of surveillance. The study the organisers did showed that this practice (agents sleeping with the objects of surveillance) went on continuously for a period of 30 years, ie, it proves we are not dealing with isolated cases of rogue agents but of a practice that was propagated by the state actors. One of the lawyers suggested to criminalise for agents to have sex with people they surveill. Still despite the public attention that has been created, the play, the book, the documentary, the public enquiry, why is it that such highly political issue as state surveillance has been kind of de-politicised via its personalisation. Yes, the women who exposed this practice did so in a personal capacity, yes, there might be as a result some responsibility apportioned, some compensation given but it seems to me this is an isolationist approach, a de-politicization, compartmentalised. At a time when in the UK there is the snoopers charter very much in the news, and there are campaigns via ngo‚Äôs civil society to push back, at the time when you have Jenny Jones scandalously been surveilled and lied on in FOI request for her files, time when Caroline Lucas legal action proved Wilson doctrine is a puff of air, time when JA surveilled 24/7 at enormous cost etc etc at the time when Trade Unionists expose and push back regarding blacklisting, why is it that all these matters are not unified under the same banner and find a loud political voice in Westminster. So yes, WL statement has various levels, 1. What does it take to create public opinion to react to the Fredriksson scandal? perhaps the personal drama of the women or men he was involved with sexually, even then it might be that society only sees the wrong in his conduct only under the prism of personal betrayal which they will describe as abuse. 2. What does it take for Swedish public opinion to see it is the Swedish state that is behaving in this manner, ie it is a political matter, that Fredriksson deceived, lied and manipulated because it was in his job description, he received a salary for it and he had a performance appraisal at the end of it, all paid for by the Swedish Taxpayer. 3. When does the Swedish public opinion define such behaviour as corruption, ie state surveilance, deception, manipulation is corruption, even in a ‚Äòdemocracy‚Äô.",2016-03-09 08:49:35,Emmy B

"This kind of slow, silent expansionism that we see in the Aegan makes me think that ‚Äòneutral zones‚Äô have no chance of survival in this world, because the most powerful country in question would surely find a way to slowly overcome the ‚Äòneutral‚Äô barrier. When in NYC we were discussing about possible political solutions for the Israel-Palestine problem, someone in my committee came up and proposed to transform Jerusalem and a small area around it into ‚Äòinternational zone‚Äô, therefore neutral and supervised by the UN. When he said that ‚Äì even if the situation are different ‚Äì this Turkey-Greece case popped up in my mind. I mean, here we see a ‚Äòfrontier zone‚Äô between Turkey and Greece, but this frontier zone is blurred because of the presence of sea and various islands, so even if officially there‚Äôs an established sovereignty, it‚Äôs easy to create ‚Äògrey zones‚Äô, make everything less fixed, and therefore giving Turkey possibility to expand without using violence, that would attract uncomfortable world‚Äôs attention. In the Israel-Palestine zone is pretty much the same: there have been episodes of intense violence, but the core of Israeli invasion is being made by slowly eroding Palestinian territories, by seizing metre after metre. And, well, it‚Äôs clear that this would happen in the case of a neutral zone too. Plus, if we consider that the external superpowers will help the powerful country in question (as NATO with Turkey, more or less), neutral zones can be nothing but facades.",2016-03-13 11:07:01,voidiss

"Russia has never been serious neither will they be now. No idea about China. in 1770 (read Orlof) Greeks handed it on the plate, no Russia took what they wanted from Turkey after encouraging insurgency and revolution in Greece as a distraction, then dropped Greeks like a hot potato. In 1917 lost in their own revolution Russia was the first to sign peace treaty with Ataturk prompting the other ‚Äògreat powers‚Äô of the time to scram in competition with the other to sign peace treaties with Turkey leaving Greek army in the middle of Anatolia fighting alone, a complete defeat that led to the catastrophic Lozanne treaty of 1923. In Yalta, they sold off Greece outright to the West despite having a very loyal communist led national army on their side. That is why I don‚Äôt think they are serious.

"Then in the treaty of Moudros in Lemnos Ottoman Empire was broken up and 2 years later in 1920 The Treatie of Sevres articles 62 and 64 mentioned the creation of Kurdistan. Soon after the allies peace making and the defeat of the greek army meant there was no one to make the new Turkey comply with such articles. The Kurdish issue has reached certain maturity today. We are watching what will Russia will do, will they be successful in getting the Kurds to sit around the table at the UN peace negotiations for Syria? Will they clench the deal for a Syrian Kurdish state? They have invited Dimitras (Kurds in Turkey) to open offices in Moscow, will they follow through or will they damp them once they get what they want in Syria?",2016-03-13 11:49:28,Emmy B

Crisis avoided for now. Junior gov partner ‚ÄòIndependent Greeks‚Äô convened a meeting and decided to support the government but they demand Refugee petty minister muzalas resignation over his error to call FYROM ‚ÄòMacedonia‚Äô in public.,2016-03-17 08:43:00,Emmy B
"Everyone is calling FYROM Macedonia, he got carried away and made a simple mistake for which he has apologised. The problem is not so much the name but the irredentism coming from FYROM with territorial claims and rhetoric identical to the 1940‚Äôs Bulgarian Macedonian ‚Äòstate‚Äô established by Burgaria in WWII. For those who do not know, Bulgaria was part of the Axis in WWII and one of the three occupying forces in Greece together with Italy and Germany. The Bulgarians were the worst of the three in occupying Greece because they materialised their strategic goal to access to the Aegean Archipelago. During the earlier 20th century Balkan Wars. Greece militarily defeated Bulgaria and so the newly liberated from Ottoman rule became part of Greece. Then there was an agreed exchange of population between Greece and Bulgaria as a means to bring ‚Äòstability‚Äô which happened. In WWII Bulgaria as part of axis took the opportunity to be extra brutal as part of ethnic cleansing efforts to annex the area for good. After the war they paid reparations to Greece. That is why the FYROM rhetoric is so difficult to accept. On the surface everyone is talking ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs in a name?‚Äô thinking Greece is unreasonable. But the issue is complex.",2016-03-17 09:01:33,Emmy B
"No one in Greece is challenging FYROM‚Äôs right to sovereignty self rule or borders. The collapse of the Iron curtain was looked favourably at home in the 90‚Äôs as finally Greece would be able to trade with its northern neighbours. No one anticipated the irredentism and nationalistic bravado of the past that had dominated early 20th century geopolitics and state formation would be coming back to life as a result of the breakdown of Yugoslavia. 2.5 million of its southern inhabitants declared self rule. Great but why would they chose to alienate 20% of its population that is Albanian (they are not Slavs) by identifying with the Greek Macedonian identity whilst they are not Greek. They claim ancient Macedon was not Greek as if the two are mutually exclusive, a historical ignorance of mammoth proportions ‚ÄúWe call greek all those who share our culture‚Äù was the definition of Greeks in ancient time (common language, religion, traditions, trading relations) but that world had dozens of kingdoms, city states, islands without formal state structure. Some shared alliances and others fought bitter wars between them. Phillip of Macedon was the first with the ambition to unite all Greeks under his Kingdom and Alexander the Great realised this ambition then went on to conquer other territories, the rest is history. To conclude, you could be a Greek and not a Macedon (eg you could be a Thracian Greek like Thukididis or an Athenian Greek like Pericles, a Spartian Greek like Leonidas) but you could not be a Macedon without being Greek.",2016-03-17 09:34:43,Emmy B
"apologies for the long rants but you see it all ties in with the geopolitics of our era. I will put some links here in case anyone would like to read the issues. Could this issue bring down the government? Well I don‚Äôt think the minority party ‚ÄòIndependent Greeks‚Äô would make such a fuss if it was not important for their long term electoral survival. On the other hand it shows the pressures this government is under when practically nothing goes its way.

The Turks landed in Alexandroupolis helicopter Blackhawk, (photo from e-evros.gr) hoping that this will escape the consequences of their involvement in the attempted coup against Erdogan. The government spokeswoman Olga Gerovasili said that the eight arrested accused Turkey of violating the constitutional legitimacy and participation in coup aiming to overthrow democracy and hinted that it will be very difficult not to be extradited. She pointed out that all legal procedures will be adhered to but she stressed twice in a television interview in ERT that the offenses for which they are accused are very serious. The point is a hot potato. An and the decision seems to be one way. The Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras was the first western politician who publicly backed Erdogan and even at the time when it was not clear which side would prevail in Turkey. It is rather difficult now to refuse extradition of eight Turks seven military and a civilian. But because in Turkey they have already begun to seriously discuss the imposition of the death penalty even for some of those involved in the coup attempt, there is an issue! The EU does not ‚Äúcover‚Äù us to extradite defendants in countries that may condemn them to death.

Erdogan will spin it as a Gulen plot,2016-07-18 08:36:13,WikiLeaks
"although he pushes that line Gulen=terrorist organisation etc etc perhaps the real danger to his power is the people closest to him within his party who perhaps wish to retain some of their power and see him as a liability. I have no idea if indeed Gulen had anything to do with the plot, or his sympathisers did, how could I, but Erdogan has marked them as his enemy and so it is. The Gulenist supporters sympathisers, if we believe the US embassy cables as an accurate source is into millions within Turkey, imagine how many have gone to the schools, have been in Gulenist trade associations or charities, Erdogan paints with the brush of terrorists a very large part of the population, it is extraordinary how he chose to act with purging thousands from positions of state, in the legal,judicial profession, the army, the police, kind of disintegrating the state and terrorising a huge part of the state apparatus and the population, introducing a chaos element within his own ranks. The enemy within, instead of ‚ÄòThe Kurds‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Greeks‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Armenians‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Laz‚Äô . I wonder how he can sustain this in the medium or long term. I get the feeling things are very much in flux. Neither can we assume that the external powers to be are currently idle. Considering the importance of Turkey militarily, Erdogan is now a liability for them too, I don‚Äôt know why Egypt comes to mind, perhaps because they were the only ones in UN not to condemn the coup attempt.",2016-07-18 09:04:42,Emmy B

SVT journalist very courteous another lady journalist was hostile, 2 women who worked with the police told us we should not be there, it was wrong for us to be there and that someone would come out soon to tell us, then they left, when a uniformed man came out he was alright just asked us to move to the other side. Many took photos or short videos silently, many smiled back, some where happy to see our messages, others enquired with specific questions. One man working with the police (plain clothes) said we should not be protesting at the police as this had nothing to do with the police it was the prosecution who was responsible, I explained that it was Marianne Ny that chose the venue, this police station and that is why we were there, he seemed embarassed.",2016-09-08 14:11:57,Emmy B

If writers of articles are Trump supporters it makes sense to put a lot more in the story to put off Christian voters against Podesta. There is real deep fear for satan/occult practices (I am given talismans every time I go to Greece for perceived protection of me and the kids from the evil eye/satan and all sorts) among Christians as this is a major pre-occupation of organised religion.,2016-11-04 14:37:27,Emmy B

it is a can of worms as well as the stuff of comic strips,2016-11-04 14:52:40,Emmy B
Right. The term comes from persecuting people based on ridiculous notions. So the hypothesis that Podesta participated in Satanic rituals should not be pushed because it distracts from his actual corrupt practices.,2016-11-04 14:53:19,M
"I am not saying that Podesta did anything like that. Still, the fear is real among Christian communities since, let‚Äôs face it, organised religion has a lot of rituals that are controlled by priests but if they are performed by lay people, it is taboo, shocking. I am not familiar with the artist in question but the theme plays to the darkest fears and instincts of people.",2016-11-04 14:58:50,Emmy B

"PS in Greece, very much dominated by a Christian culture there are often scandals about satanists or occult practices, and people tremble. There is belief in the ‚Äòevil eye‚Äô, reading the future in coffee cups, and sometimes one wonders where religion ends and magic begins as it gets blurry. üôÇ but in a set beliefs which accepts miracles and supernatural power like Christian communities do, there is also a recognition that evil powers exist represented by Satan, at a mild modern context the yin and yang but for organised church as well as people who believe, this is real. In our modern world we demand rationality above all in public office rather any sort of mumbo-jumbo although let‚Äôs not forget her ‚Äòmajesty the queen‚Äô is also head of the church of England :-p for Podesta this story is bad news.",2016-11-04 15:10:25,Emmy B

Albania under Turkish influence has ripped up the naval border agreement with Greece and FYROMacedonia continues to propagate land claims over Greece in its constitution. US foreign policy has sadly favoured all adversaries of Greece. With Greece practically bankrupt, Troika still in control and Nato patrolling the Aegean for refugees, the situation is not ideal.
