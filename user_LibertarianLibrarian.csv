"I think it’s also a fallacy to say that journalism is ‘objective’ except in cases where the evidence is clearly and openly provided, as Wikileaks has sought to do by making all documents available. Yet, even the straight out “x happened” can be shaded by personal bias. That’s a big issue in research and it reminds me of the difference between ‘analytic’ or ‘quantitative’ studies vs qualitative studies, where the latter deliberately explore personal experience and narrative. The issue is that even the best ‘analytic’ research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered. I’d rather see journalists who are capable of recognizing and accounting for their personal biases, willing to minimize those by providing documentary evidence, but without the false pretense of objectivity, as it seems that those who cry the loudest about being objective are usually the most biased.",2015-08-19 08:15:49,LibertarianLibrarian

As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid. It also tends towards defining another group as evil by nature not by action, i.e., if you’re male you are automatically bad. This happens often and is why I’ve always hated to identify myself as anything other than an individualist and a humanist. I’ve been supporting Black Lives Matter because the situation is so bad right now, but really, for me, it’s about equal treatment before the law for all.

"Whether it was a horribly mistaken or not, the election clearly showed how angry the average American is with the Washington power structure. Even if Trump’s a narcissistic moron, I was still relieved to see Clinton go down. And greetings from the geographical center of the US. My first full day in Kansas City.",2017-01-04 13:43:17,LibertarianLibrarian
"Trump could do it. He basically is focused on his own celebrity. Appeal to that. But I suspect that like Obama, he’ll be controlled.",2017-01-04 14:02:01,LibertarianLibrarian
"Good question, Emmy. I think he may make China and the Islamics (whatever they’re called lately) into the bad guys. I’m delighted to see Clinton’s anti-Russia agitating didn’t get further, but I’m worried a bit re China. Trump will have to be careful there. But I can see Trump and Putin siding together more in regards to the Middle East. Not sure if that will be a disaster or a success, probably a mix, but I’m sick of this resurgent McCarthyism recently. Bad, bad, bad idea. Trump’s a wild card. I think that’s why I wasn’t surprised he won and not upset either. He’s a sexist narcissist but that’s not new in political leaders.",2017-01-04 14:32:20,LibertarianLibrarian
Yeah. Trump’s unpredictable so… Not surprised re FBI. Dropping the ball yet again.,2017-01-04 16:41:55,LibertarianLibrarian
"It’s really bizarre how Americans have been led to believe simultaneously that Julian is under Putin’s thumb and that he’s gone ‘right wing’, both of which are clearly absurd and contradictory with each other (as most Americans still associate Russia with communism to some degree). Sarah Palin (this no endorsement of her) was ridiculed for saying the Russians are coming… Yet now it’s Clinton saying the same thing and suddenly it’s not ridiculous? I don’t get people sometimes. Believe it or not, there actually is something between your ears. Try using for it a change. Argh! Then again, Senator Schumer may actually NOT have any thing between his ears.",2017-01-07 16:06:01,LibertarianLibrarian
"Thanks. Just letting off steam. The whole Putin is the bad guy thing is absurd and out of hand. And why can’t people get the simple concept that WL can only release what it’s been given, can’t magically make up stuff on Trump. And source is irrelevant, all the stuff on Clinton and DNC is TRUE however bad Trump may or may not be. Like Duh!!! When otherwise intelligent people repeat this stuff… *steam comes out of my ears*",2017-01-07 16:18:59,LibertarianLibrarian
"Yes, good point re Podesta. I have no clue what will happen Trump is a wild card which may actually be a good thing, at the least we can watch the Washington power brokers running around after him which will be highly amusing (if they don-t gag him or worse first).",2017-01-07 16:39:38,LibertarianLibrarian
"Hmm, not sure last time all 3 in same party, though a lot of Republicans are anti-Trump. So who knows? Congressional terms are 2 years. I think they are staggered so some up every year. Senators are 4 years, and I think staggered as well. Some should be up in 2017, and definitely in 2018, etc. I’m pretty sure.",2017-01-07 16:55:45,LibertarianLibrarian

But basically, most Presidents end up tied by Washington bureaucracy, same old stuff.",2017-01-25 14:15:13,LibertarianLibrarian

"Life goes on. There’s a lot of utter disgust with Trump, Washington, etc. I suspect most people just expect to get screwed over by govt. I think most people are against that stupid Mexican wall thing. Women’s groups are generally up in arms re Trump, I’m still wondering why they weren’t the same re Bill Clinton. The fight over the pipeline still ongoing. No one has a clue what’s going to happen re Obamacare. And generally we all knew we were spied on anyway and no one ever liked the CIA, so I suspect the average person’s response is ‘so what’s new?’ Sad, but I had kinds thought the same thing.",2017-03-11 10:14:05,LibertarianLibrarian

"Can I just say that while I knew Trump was a lunatic, the latest stuff I heard is an absolute farce. Apparently his people are discussing trying to force people on Medicaid to work… but the primary reason for getting Medicaid is because you can NOT work – it goes to the handicapped and children.

Maybe it’s because I provide medical information to doctors and patient families that can affect a child’s health and life, but it just blows my mind when people misrepresent reality so casually. It’s not even a pure fact versus dramatic presentation difference, much in pediatrics is based on limited evidence and clinician judgement, but just just an ethos of personal responsibility and trust when what you do and say impacts people’s lives.
