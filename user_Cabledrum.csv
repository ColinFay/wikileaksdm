A little side note re. Bundestag Inquiry into NSA:,2015-05-14 20:12:44,Cabledrum
"Johannes Eisenberg, a (former?) lawyer of WL, served as legal adviser for seven witnesses, all from BND, incl. General Breitfelder.",2015-05-14 20:12:48,Cabledrum
"Of course, everyone has the right to legal assistance.",2015-05-14 20:12:55,Cabledrum
"But obviously, Eisenberg is a contractor of the BND. That doesn’t make him necessarily trustworthy.",2015-05-14 20:13:01,Cabledrum
"First of all, the documents show how all concerned parties systematically try to block the work of the inquiry commission.",2015-05-15 06:00:41,Cabledrum
"The witnesses from BND and Telekom “can’t remember”, “was not responsible”, “do not know” and so on",2015-05-15 06:01:04,Cabledrum
"For instance, the former CEO of Telekom, Kai-Uwe Ricke, had a four-eyes-meeting with the chief of the BND…",2015-05-15 06:01:51,Cabledrum
…but can’t remember what they’ve been talking about,2015-05-15 06:01:55,Cabledrum
"The newspaper article you mentioned, “Kauder and Maaßen criticize WikiLeaks”, comes from the “Welt”, a very conservative newspaper",2015-05-15 06:02:33,Cabledrum
Volker Kauder (CDU parliamentary leader) is a conservative hardliner.Hans-Georg Maaßen is the chief of Germany’s domestic secret service BfV,2015-05-15 06:03:42,Cabledrum
Kauder criticizes that the WL release “might threaten the cooperation of German secret services with the NSA”,2015-05-15 06:04:03,Cabledrum

"Great find, Emmy! Imho, we can tweet it. It’s archived and several witnesses have seen it. It doesn’t matter whether he deletes the tweets",2015-05-18 09:56:29,Cabledrum
"Grmpf, ok. 3 days left until court decision…",2015-05-18 10:51:44,Cabledrum
"Very good, Emmy! This is evidence for both, the forum and the twitter acc. The forum post is still online with his name on the screenshots",2015-05-19 04:01:09,Cabledrum
Jenny : “Catch him by surprise in court” doesn’t work out in Germany. All evidence has to be presented to the court in advance 🙁,2015-05-19 04:04:17,Cabledrum

I’ve removed this tweet 3 day later by request of [MGT]’s lawyer.,2015-05-20 11:15:29,Cabledrum
"I have no idea why they seek a preliminary injunction, in spite of the fact that the concerned tweet has already been removed",2015-05-20 11:15:35,Cabledrum
Today’s court decision in my case has been postponed until tomorrow for technical reasons,2015-05-21 06:40:52,Cabledrum
"There has been a “fairly final” decision in PC’s case, but I don’t know any details yet",2015-05-21 06:41:17,Cabledrum
"Bad news: As it seems, the court has rejected PC’s claim",2015-05-21 08:18:56,Cabledrum
WL: The court didn’t explain the decision in any way. We have to wait for the written reasons for the judgment,2015-05-21 10:55:26,Cabledrum
PC intends to appeal against the judgement by all means,2015-05-21 10:58:03,Cabledrum
I still don’t have a court decision. The clerk’s office of the court was closed today for unknown reasons.,2015-05-22 08:13:16,Cabledrum
"Monday is a bank holiday in Germany, so we have to wait until Tuesday",2015-05-22 08:13:23,Cabledrum
"WL: If I win, MGT has to pay my lawyer and the court costs, all in all approx. 3000 Euros, plus his own lawyer",2015-05-22 15:42:24,Cabledrum
"That message is not part of the website but part of the URL, harmless crap. Example: http://tinyurl.com/py8vkcd",2015-05-22 19:49:01,Cabledrum
The Frankfurt district court has annulled the preliminary injunction concerning the publication of [MGT]’s photo 🙂,2015-05-26 06:28:08,Cabledrum
The court seems to be completely overloaded. I still have to wait for the written reasons for the judgment “for one or two weeks”,2015-05-26 06:31:56,Cabledrum
"No. MGT has to pay the court fees and the lawyers, since he lost",2015-05-26 06:35:24,Cabledrum
"But I’m afraid that he has a legal protection insurance, in contrast to me",2015-05-26 06:37:02,Cabledrum
"It’s 3 bills, one from the court and 2 from the lawyers. My lawyer already sent his bill to MGT today",2015-05-26 06:39:53,Cabledrum
"I don’t know. Legal protection insurance is expensive. I guess, that he concluded an insurance after the PC case started",2015-05-26 06:42:33,Cabledrum
"hmm, that’s a very long way, could take years",2015-05-26 06:43:28,Cabledrum
"yes, that’s why he sued me for the recent publications of his photo but ignored the publications of last year",2015-05-26 06:48:03,Cabledrum
Just for the records: MGT only lost the preliminary injunction now. The principal proceedings in this case goes on trial in October,2015-05-26 06:57:06,Cabledrum
WL: It’s just an assumption that MGT has a legal insurance. I have no idea which one it might be.,2015-05-26 11:51:25,Cabledrum

hazel: Has Twitter notified you in any way or has the tweet just disappeared?,2015-05-28 09:36:00,Cabledrum
"Strange! Twitter didn’t ask me to remove my tweets, they are still online. Due to the court decision there is no legal reason to remove them",2015-05-28 10:30:32,Cabledrum
I’ve just received the written reasons for the judgement on the annulment of the injunction. It says almost nothing.,2015-06-01 17:20:42,Cabledrum
A preliminary injunction requires urgency and the only reason for the annulment is the lack of urgency in this case.,2015-06-01 17:20:47,Cabledrum
The court has neither judged whether the publication of his photo is a violation of MGT’s rights nor whether he is responsible for FWLF.,2015-06-01 17:21:04,Cabledrum
This judgements are deferred until the principal proceedings in October.,2015-06-01 17:21:16,Cabledrum
MGT falsely claimed that he wasn’t aware of the publication of his photo before January 2015.,2015-06-01 18:00:19,Cabledrum
"He forgot that he demanded the removal of this photo already in April 2014, by written letter.",2015-06-01 18:00:22,Cabledrum
This is the ONLY reason why the court has annulled the injunction.,2015-06-01 18:00:27,Cabledrum
PC’s case: I have no update yet. She is still waiting for the written reasons of judgement.,2015-06-01 18:00:54,Cabledrum

The prosecutor has terminated the proceedings against MGT for perjury. We will contest this decision at the Prosecutor General.,2016-04-29 01:29:20,Cabledrum

I have finally lost the court case against MGT. The judgement cannot be appealed.,2016-05-03 07:31:03,Cabledrum
This means that it is illegal under German law to use the photo of MGT. I have to remove the photo from my server immediately.,2016-05-03 07:31:07,Cabledrum

"Similar to media censorship, I really would like to understand how it actually works. Do the judges decide on their own because they are biased against anything with the “WikiLeaks” label?
