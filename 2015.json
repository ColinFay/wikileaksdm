Together with the slight distortion of history (the word ‚Äòno‚Äô never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual ‚Äògarment‚Äô. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the ‚Äòtribal chief‚Äô of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the ‚Äògreater Macedonia‚Äô claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to ‚Äòliberate‚Äô those historic lands that are currently under foreign control‚Ä¶ all this referring to ‚Äòthe Greater Macedonian Myth‚Äô created by Bulgarians in the 40‚Äôs.

Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy.

Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army‚Äôs role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can‚Äôt see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters.

And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‚Äòsimulation‚Äô of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‚Äòresolution‚Äô. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don‚Äôt want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‚Äòhow things work‚Äô in UN etc. A bit like ‚Äòknow the enemy‚Äô, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway‚Ä¶ today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I‚Äôll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‚Äòdelegate‚Äô are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan.
