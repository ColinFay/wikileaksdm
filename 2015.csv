"When as a child once was asked to offer my chair to my brother as he entered the room so as to sit next to the fire. There was no logic or fact required, reason had nothing to do with it. I had to make space for him and I did. Such articles that I have read JV producing is telling the world there is no space close to the fire for JA, others have to sit there.

"It is the use of tools of social exclusion (oppression) that are perceived to have been (and be being) used against them.

Experience shld be heard and has it‚Äôs own legitimate space, and this is of its essence an emotional space ‚Äì people‚Äôs personal narrative is a vital part of the truth. That can be as expressed in as extreme a way as people‚Äôs emotions are.

"I think it‚Äôs also a fallacy to say that journalism is ‚Äòobjective‚Äô except in cases where the evidence is clearly and openly provided, as Wikileaks has sought to do by making all documents available. Yet, even the straight out ‚Äúx happened‚Äù can be shaded by personal bias. That‚Äôs a big issue in research and it reminds me of the difference between ‚Äòanalytic‚Äô or ‚Äòquantitative‚Äô studies vs qualitative studies, where the latter deliberately explore personal experience and narrative. The issue is that even the best ‚Äòanalytic‚Äô research always has some level of potential bias and when evaluating it, the risk of bias must be considered. I‚Äôd rather see journalists who are capable of recognizing and accounting for their personal biases, willing to minimize those by providing documentary evidence, but without the false pretense of objectivity, as it seems that those who cry the loudest about being objective are usually the most biased.",2015-08-19 08:15:49,LibertarianLibrarian

The piece is kind of ‚Äòlanguid‚Äô, flits about. Probably because he is unfamiliar with/uninterested in the real issues (as in geopolitics/justice/truth etc!). But he doesn‚Äôt go on about the Swedish case at all; there‚Äôs much more about the US case, which he seems to take at face-value (despite that quote fr Appleyard). So it‚Äôs good in that it doesn‚Äôt belittle the threat to Assange even saying ‚Äúhe may be right about that‚Äù w ref to JA‚Äôs conviction that Ny‚Äôs delaying tactics are to serve the US timescale, enable them to build their case. The worst thing is, that, apart from a ref to the ‚Äúhorrifying footage‚Äù of Collateral Murder, he has no regard for/understanding of the ground-breaking work of WikiLeaks, or JA‚Äôs role (so, what‚Äôs new?). It ends with the terrible ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a hero to many in the land of protest for protest‚Äôs sake‚Äù after citing who he‚Äôs a villain to and why.

"In Greece we all celebrate proudly the day of oxi = no (1940 ‚Äì WWII). It was not actually said as such but this is how it remains in history‚Ä¶ as a ‚Äòno you cannot pass your armies into Greece through the Albanian border Mussolini, we shall fight‚Äô. Together with the slight distortion of history (the word ‚Äòno‚Äô never was said, although Greece did not acquiesce to the Italian army advance and fought) most Greeks forget that Metaxas, the politician in charge of Greece at the time was a brutal dictator. He was a confirmed fascist who propagated everything that Mussolini and Hitler propagated albeit in a ancient Greek toga intellectual ‚Äògarment‚Äô. Assad equally is a political dictator albeit considering the plurality of religions and nations within Syria, he is also the ‚Äòtribal chief‚Äô of the Allawites. Forgive me I am hardly an expert in matters Syrian but there is no doubt in my mind the Greeks would rather have Metaxa the dictator than Mussolini the dictator. I think most people can understand why. Mussolini too had a plan to split Greece into parts and in fact during the 4 years of occupation Greece was split into three parts The Italian, The German, The Bulgarian. Out of all three the Bulgarian was considered the most barbaric as ethnic cleansing was part of the agenda to truly expand Bulgaria giving it access into the Aegean. The current problems between Greece and FYROM or Macedonia over the name stem from that period of Bulgarian occupation when the occupiers (Bulgarians) to consolidate their rule and cement it for the future created the ‚Äògreater Macedonia‚Äô claiming it as a separate state, nation, in fact, and starting to manufacture the historic revisionism so helpful in propaganda. If the occupation had lasted longer than 4 years the map of Greece would today be very different. FYROM to this day includes in its national constitution a commitment to ‚Äòliberate‚Äô those historic lands that are currently under foreign control‚Ä¶ all this referring to ‚Äòthe Greater Macedonian Myth‚Äô created by Bulgarians in the 40‚Äôs.

Just so people know there is now evidence with the German Court that FWLF is owned by [redacted] wife of MGT and registered at the address that MGT lives. The French hosting co of wikileaks .com has provided documentary evidence after a French court order. Chris has been very busy over the summer and her appeal has been submitted a few weeks ago. MGT is aware of this development. Now awaiting for further legal steps but have no timeline. Please show discretion. There is no need for this information to be the subject of twitter exchanges at this stage. FWLF twitter account was suspended for a period of 10 days due to Chris‚Äôs complaint for targeted abuse. FWLF has deleted some but not all offending tweets. I personally do not expect any further news on the subject till christmas.,2015-09-16 08:57:51,Emmy B

"Jenny wonderful you helped him with his english! I thought it was well written <3 Greek society was very much in flux as I was growing up there, huge differences in attitudes btw city and country for example and from social group to social group. In general women had it tough in a patriarchal society (not to ignore that patriarchy limits mens freedom too not just women‚Äôs) but my generation had many more opportunities that ever before which went hand in hand with political developments for the better across society. One here in the UK would laugh to read that some occupational insurance funds in Greece would pay out pensions to unmarried women if their father passed away for example but this was a recognition that ‚Äòin those days‚Äô women could not be financially independent through outside paid work. Other provisions like first born boys of a widow or divorced woman would get reduced time in National Service as they were considered head of the family, i.e. financially providing for their mothers and other dependent members‚Ä¶ I mean where do you put such arrangements in the grand literature of feminism?

"It‚Äôs saddening, deeply saddening. Once innovative and strong movements such as feminism are turning into a doctrine. Feminism started long ago and it was a wave of change‚Ä¶ I remember the suffragettes in ‚Äò900, for example; Alice Paul and women‚Äôs right to vote in America. They protested and fight and even were jailed for this, they represented a strong dissent. And now‚Ä¶ now feminism is the emobiement of stagnation. It can be used to promote a certain propaganda, to censor and to defend only a close group‚Äôs human rights leaving out all the rest to be destroyed: But more than this, it is ‚Äòconquering the term‚Äô; I mean, real feminism isn‚Äôt that ‚Äútrigger warning‚Äù/‚Äùrape culture‚Äù crap, but this flawed part of feminism has grown and grown and of course ‚Äî as every other conservative/reactionary ideology ‚Äî has got the better of true feminism and crippled it by becoming the widespread conception of the term. Now everyone who wants to make people know that cares about women‚Äôs rights and has desire to fight for them, has to define himself/herself feminist, because if you don‚Äôt do, you have less credibility in the realm of feminism, but by doing so you‚Äôre indirectly endorsing a doctrine which is wrong and obliges you to adapt to it if you don‚Äôt want to be left out.",2015-10-14 09:34:12,voidiss

And again, all this just helps to value more well-being instead of free speech ‚Äì expressed with other words, but it‚Äôs the same old contrast of security vs freedom so loved by NSA and every govt.

"Yes, I can remember in college arguing with ‚Äòfeminists‚Äô that I had an equal right to choose between a career or staying home and raising kidd and being told I didn‚Äôt, that if I chose the latter, I was participating in the patriarchal system, etc. If you don‚Äôt accept and parrot their exact ideology, you‚Äôre labeled as ‚Äòantifeminist‚Äô which is an insult without real meaning but gets easily thrown at anyone they don‚Äôt like. As you say, dissent or alternative ideas are not allowed. The ideology becomes rigid. It also tends towards defining another group as evil by nature not by action, i.e., if you‚Äôre male you are automatically bad. This happens often and is why I‚Äôve always hated to identify myself as anything other than an individualist and a humanist. I‚Äôve been supporting Black Lives Matter because the situation is so bad right now, but really, for me, it‚Äôs about equal treatment before the law for all.

"During the junta years 1969-1974 in Greece most newspapers continued their operation, self censoring. It was a most brutal dictatorship, thousands tortured as a control, punitive and reformative process, still Greek society continued to function and newspapers continued to operate. Yes there were individual cases of resistance and some efforts for organised revolt in a small scale but nothing in a grand scale. Institutions adjusted their behaviour to the new situation and found ways to turn a blind eye or partly justify their position by quietly acquiescing. In the end the junta imploded from within. It was the army generals who decided to bring a return to democracy. They were dismayed at the junta‚Äôs treasonous effort to overthrow unsuccessfully the democratic government of Cyprus, handing Turkey the premeditated ‚Äòway in‚Äô to invade and partition the island. Having committed in effect National Treason of the greatest degree in opening the door to the brutal enemy‚Äôs worst plans, some generals and right wing politicians came to an accord, to bring back Karamanlis, restore democracy in return for impunity for the treason, and impunity for most of the junta‚Äôs crimes. I bring this as an example to illustrate the sad fact that Democracy and what it means to our society is only as precious as we give it and the value of its currency is only determined by the action we are prepared to take to keep it safe.",2015-10-29 03:30:25,Emmy B

At the same time UCLU have got into a mess re Macer Gifford. It‚Äôs delicate because Gifford‚Äôs supporters are insinuating at some sort of ‚ÄòIslamist‚Äô bias against them in the union and mentioning orgs like Cage negatively and Cage‚Äôs is a counter narrative that I have supported.

"Official Greek position regarding Paris aftermath: 1. Greece will not participate in any military operation in Syria as part of NATO, its role in the crisis is to remain a stable partner. 2. Solution for avoiding such terror attacks is the exchange of info among Nato countries intelligence services. With regards to backlash on Refugee crisis. 1. Greek army‚Äôs role is defensive, it will support refugee crisis but will not be managing it, i.e. Greece is treating the migration move as a humanitarian crisis not as a enemies that the army has to defend against. Coast Guard, Frontex and other civil institutions are managing the situation under civilian management. 2. There will be no joint Greek Turkish patrols in Greek territorial waters. (Reminding people there are no international waters between Greek and Turkish sea border, Turkey does not recognise Greek sovereignty in half the Aegean, basically does what it likes when it suits). Joint Greek/Turkish coast guard exists albeit Turkish coast guard is better equipped than Greek and since they let the dingies leave their coast without intercepting them anyway, I just can‚Äôt see how they can suddenly intercept them if they are to go into Greek waters. In Turkish waters are invisible and suddenly in Greek waters are visible?",2015-11-16 02:48:28,Emmy B
"Greek Navy is not involved in the operations currently but Turks will bring them in (remember they do what they like their navy already trespasses frequently and forces the Greek navy and airforce to be shadowing them around). If Turkish navy get‚Äôs an in then Greek Navy is forced to participate, then the scene is set for skirmishes and red alert tensions on a daily bases btw Turkish/Greek vessels. If anyone thinks all this has anything to do with saving refugees they can think again, consider what we are dealing with: 1. desperate people 2. ruthless traffickers 3. flimsy dingies. Why, if military vessel as much as approach one of these dinghies the waves they makes might just topple the dingy, not to mention that Traffickers advise refugees that the moment they see the coast guard to sink the dingy so then coast guard is forced to launch a saving operation rather than toe them back to the sea border and co-ordinate with Turkish coast guard to pick them up (this used to happen a lot where some small vessels were forced to return to Turkey) With the weather deteriorating from week to week the death toll increases, the journey is even more perilous.",2015-11-16 02:56:57,Emmy B

Extremely important article on Greek Satirical Magazine ‚ÄòTo Pondiki‚Äô issue published 12/11/2015 regarding National Security and Sovereignty implications of TiSA with regards to the Aegean. It refers heavily on earlier WikiLeaks release on TiSA via local Partner Kathimerini to highlight that current EU policy via Merkel and Junker (pressurising Greece to accept Turkish involvement in ‚Äòguarding‚Äô Greek sea borders regarding the influx of immigrants/refugees) reflects commitments that EU has already made to Turkey via TiSA reminding that Turkey was responsible for formulating the TiSA naval/sea chapter and as a result it formulated it in a manner to protect and enhance its own interests to the detriment of the Greek interests and sovereignty.,2015-11-16 04:33:45,Emmy B
"Unless I am an expert in such matters, which I am not, I cannot really have my own opinion on the matter as I have not studied the TiSA chapter let alone understanding what it really means for Greece. Greek Academics might have approached the matter but nothing has come up that I have read on the matter (Kathimerini did not exactly make a fuss at the time of publication) and anyway the media is pre-occupied so much about the economic crisis and the refugee crisis little energy or attention is paid to other matters.",2015-11-16 04:36:53,Emmy B

It is alright for Erdogan to conveniently claim ‚Äòit was ISIS‚Äô and fit with West‚Äôs political hypocritical rhetoric about giving a damn for a problem they have created and sustain as a tool of furthering their influence and control in the region.

"I‚Äôm doing a thing I‚Äôd like to share with you all‚Ä¶ This year my school offered the partecipation in a project called NHSMUN (National High School Model United Nation), that is a big project initially created by IMUNA and organized by different associated orgs in each country (like Italian Diplomatic Academy in Italy). And this project practically gives students the possibility to take part in a course of geopolitics, international relations, diplomacy etc and at the end of it, they can to go to NYC, at the UN palace, to do a ‚Äòsimulation‚Äô of work as delegates of various countries different from their own. In practice, students are assigned to a country, choose a Committee with two topics, follow the course and do research on the country and the topics, write a position paper and then go to NYC and debate with other students and do negotiations and in the end they prepare a ‚Äòresolution‚Äô. This aims to help young people who want to become diplomats or something. Obviously I don‚Äôt want to be a diplomat AT ALL, but I decided to participate anyway because I think it would be interesting to directly experience ‚Äòhow things work‚Äô in UN etc. A bit like ‚Äòknow the enemy‚Äô, lol. (joking!) The course started about a month ago and we already did various lessons on UN system and contemporary history (Cold War mostly). The history teacher was quite good, the other was strongly pro-USG instead (he supports TPP/TISA, loves Hillary and tried to deny the existence of WL docs on Saudi and UK plotting to be elected to UNHRC). But anyway, the course can still be interesting if you follow it with some critical mind. Anyway‚Ä¶ today I was assigned to the country I have to represent, that is Ivory Coast. The Committee in which I‚Äôll work is the Special Political and Decolonization Committee, and the two topics I will have to analyze as Ivory Coast ‚Äòdelegate‚Äô are: 1) Palestinian Refugees in the Middle East, 2) Occupied Territories in Azerbaijan.

"Oh yes, a lot of fun! CCC is always great, a wonderful opportunity to meet many people, and plus this year there are many interesting lectures. This morning I followed one about the philosophical concept of privacy based on Hannah Arendt thoughts, and it was great. Also the one about the terrible line adopted by France in terms of surveillance was good, even if very depressing. Yesterday I followed one in which the speaker showed some photos from the Stasi archives which were hilarious (spies taking photos of enemy spies that was taking photos of them, or spies taking photos of themselves in mirrors). And the speaker also noted that while Stasi archives are more or less public and accessible, when he asked to the BND they gave him meaningless photos, so everyone can see how bad Stasi was but no one can see the crimes that surely also BND committed in that period.",2015-12-28 13:33:32,voidiss
