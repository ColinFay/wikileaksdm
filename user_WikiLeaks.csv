"Now only SW is left, Fritz and NY have moved to exploit the situation, with a cyber-harrassment themed counter-attack.",2015-08-18 05:14:28,WikiLeaks
SW has given an interview to Valenti as part of the package.,2015-08-18 05:15:27,WikiLeaks
"SW is on record many times early in the case denying having been raped and accusing the police, so they have an up hill battle",2015-08-18 05:16:59,WikiLeaks
"painting her as a victim. So they’re going to instead show that she’s a ‘victim’ of trolls and conspiracy theorists, e.g http://sofiawilen.com",2015-08-18 05:18:13,WikiLeaks
And posit that this is what happens to all women who are brave enough to report sex crimes.,2015-08-18 05:19:24,WikiLeaks
"This will resonate with the many women who now work in (social) media, and who due to their public profiles, have been the target of trolls and also legitimate criticism which some reframe as harressment.",2015-08-18 05:20:52,WikiLeaks
"Models Valenti is likely looking to exploit are Nicklas Kristof’s “news dressed as opinion” attack on Woody Allen, Gamer Gate, and the recent campus rape debate in US, where she made the following telling claim:",2015-08-18 05:26:09,WikiLeaks
"“Whether she is able to remain anonymous or not, and even though her story of being raped has not been disproven, the fact that Jackie is not and was not a symbol or a cause, but a person, has been lost in the rush to indict her and anyone who believes her.

"Jackie was subsequently shown to be a fraud, but Valenti was correct to say “I lose nothing by doing so, even if I’m later proven wrong”.

Check out the sort of creature Fritz is: http://www.advokatfritz.com/,2015-08-18 05:52:22,WikiLeaks
"A few years ago in Sweden they intruced a measure which superficially sounds reasonable, to provide alleged victims with their own state funded lawyers.",2015-08-18 05:54:05,WikiLeaks
"However, look at how it works in practice. The accused is up against a state funded team from the prosecution, another from the police, and, say in JA’s case, another two state funded lawyers for the accusers.",2015-08-18 05:55:53,WikiLeaks
"In terms of the process and law, there’s only three things the state funded accusers lawyers can do: 1) massage the text of the complaint to ensure it has all the necessay elements to secure a conviction. In Sweden that’s strong, since the “complaint” can always be resubmitted.",2015-08-18 05:58:55,WikiLeaks
"2) advice the accuser on how not to be convicted for false reporting, for example, asking for advice about an HIV test rather than making a complaint",2015-08-18 06:00:22,WikiLeaks
"3) public relations. For example, nearly all of Borgstrom’s bill was for speaking to journalists. Just for SW he billed for 80 hours of interviews. Normally lawyers do interviews for free, since it is free advertising for them.",2015-08-18 06:01:25,WikiLeaks

"She works closely with NY, who now handles all ‘rape’ cases in Sweden. Together thay tag-team the accused.",2015-08-18 06:04:25,WikiLeaks
Look at Borgstrom’s bill. He even billed the state for reading NY-JA lawyers correspondence. In other words NY was forwarding the defence correspondence.
